0,ChIJdx5uQ4NE0i0RxAGZcE6Wyrg,INFINITY8 BALI,Gras Fresser,2,"Spent one night here and it was more than enough. The place is supposed to be classy but it‚Äôs actually just too big and cheaply decorated, no flair just emptiness. The rooftop pictures look a lot better than reality, everything‚Äôs made of plastic. Staff was nice but not very professional, they made us wait a number of times for useless things until a manager came to tell us we could go.

Note: the hotel response on google is just copy+paste every single time, this shows how much they care about you personally.",1945
1,ChIJdx5uQ4NE0i0RxAGZcE6Wyrg,INFINITY8 BALI,Taylor Currie,4,"The room was great. Comfortable bed. Really enjoyed the room. The breakfast was great but lunch and dinner the service was terrible. Lots of staff milling around but took a long time to get a menu, a long time to have our orders taken, a long time to receive our drinks and even longer to receive our food. Could not get the attention if staffs. Not even looking. At the guests. Looked like no one knew what they were supposed to be doing but a large number of staff present. Waited ages even to receive the dining bill and there were like 5 staff and only 3 tables. Really need to lift your service game. A friend also stayed in a other room and we dined there a few times and we always said I wonder how long this will take us. The dinners were pretty average too. Friend waited 50 minutes after ordering the Ikan to receive it and there was only one other table. Terrible dining service. Terrible.",4739
2,ChIJdx5uQ4NE0i0RxAGZcE6Wyrg,INFINITY8 BALI,Roman Gorbunov,2,"Impressions about this hotel were very ambiguous.

Pros:
1. Two clean pools, comfortable water temperature.
2. Delicious breakfasts, there is always something to choose from, and if something is over, they immediately bring it.
3. Incredibly friendly and helpful staff, everyone speaks good English.
4. Stylish, cozy rooms with a refrigerator, comfortable beds and 6! pillows, I'm impressed.
5. There is a gym, monoblocks for work, free billiards, two bars-restaurants.
6. The hotel is constantly undergoing painting and plastering work, everything is being repaired, the hotel is being monitored.

Minuses:

1. At breakfast, almost all plates and cups are dirty - they contain traces of scrambled eggs, fruits, coffee, tea and other food, they wash dishes very poorly.
2. Fruits and vegetables are cut in the evening, by morning the watermelons will be sluggish, and one day I came across sour tomatoes.
3. There is no sound insulation - all sounds are heard from the corridor, roosters are yelling outside the window, even at night, the sound of transport is very audible.
4. In the pool, many boards on the floor come off and stagger, you can easily stumble, the ottomans are all dirty.
5. Every day the same music plays loudly in the dining room, the same songs are played in the pool every day.
6. The refrigerator in the room does not work, they promised to fix it, but no one came.
7. When the door was closed, cement poured out and stained my clothes.
8. Two bars often don't have beer.
9. The bar with billiards is extremely hot, the air conditioners are not turned on, it is impossible to breathe.
10. If people get out of the elevator, and you enter the elevator, you will definitely be hit by doors.
11.The last thing that shocked me the most: I wanted to take another number, I asked why the price is so high? The hotel manager called me, said about the high workload (although there were many free rooms in the application), I replied that she was talking nonsense, to which she said: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like the price, you can leave our hotel.‚Äù
I have not seen such rudeness and disgusting attitude towards the guest anywhere, in any country. Judging by the voice, the manager was drunk, and it is completely unacceptable to talk to guests in this way.",4174
3,ChIJdx5uQ4NE0i0RxAGZcE6Wyrg,INFINITY8 BALI,Sarath Kumar,3,"Very nice, clean and well maintained hotel.
There was unfortunate accident happened with my family member, slipped and got injured after swimming. It's due to the raining and we used room slippers for going to swimming. These slippers are not intended to use outside of room and also provided instructions in room but we missed to read.
However after accident the hotel response was very good. Provided hotel car to rush to hospital and waited till the treatment completed for few hours. Also arranged very  early breakfast and airport drop.
I suggest to remove these slippers entirely as I checked many persons using outside room.
Thanks",4354
4,ChIJdx5uQ4NE0i0RxAGZcE6Wyrg,INFINITY8 BALI,Souad Al,1,"The service at Hotel Infinity8 was absolutely atrocious.

But....
Its old and absolutely in needbfir a revamp. Toilets, rooms, beds all could use a bit of newness. We stayed at a good price but were fooled by the images on booking .com
A bit far away from the beaches, need a ride  on a main road. Our room was on the roadside. Busy road a lot of noise all night.",3399
11,ChIJSWQ_MM5G0i0R4tdodWT0918,"Atanaya Hotel - Kuta, Bali",N R,5,"Stayed here for 1 week. Had an executive King room which was nice and big as expected, with a nice bathroom and king size bed. Bed was great! Just the right level of soft/firm with small memory foam topper.

Staff are very friendly, every time you walk past reception they will all greet you or give you a nod. Very helpful when we had kettle issues (replacement didn't work either) so the engineer came to test the electrics in the room, turned out to be just 2 dodgy kettles! Was rectified nice and quick though.

Breakfast was good. Didn't know what to expect, but a big buffet of Asian dishes, then cereals, porridge (bubur) and toast and eggs. Nice selection of two different juices a day which rotated and lots of tea and coffee. As a westerner with allergies meaning I can't eat alot of Asian food, I managed to get a good size breakfast every day. Wait staff are helpful and bring things to your table such as eggs and toast.

Rooftop pool is amazing. We only used it once, and the seating area by it a few more times, but it is a great addition, perfect for coming back to if you've been out for a long walk to cool off. They serve drinks and food up there too.

Restaurant, is a bit disappointing, very very small portions. Good portions for a lite bite, but not to fill you up for dinner.

Finally location is pretty good, but a 20-30min walk to the beach and 20-25min walk to legion street (main Street). This would usually be ok, however the streets are so full of mopeds and road users, it can take twice as long, as you have to sometimes wait 3-4 mins to cross any road you come across safely! We ended up walking to places then getting a Grab back.

Finally, the rooms didn't have that great soundproofing. We had a small/toddler sized child in the room next to us who was VERY noisy at all hours of the night. We didn't complain, but I'm sure if we did it would have been handled properly by the staff.

Good hotel, great staff, but think we would book more central if we were to come back.",3391

The rooms were a little sparse and things were not well maintained eg the mirror had a lot of black spots on it. My friends room had a very old and suspicious looking kettle set while mine was new and much nicer. The staff were courteous and good but the actual room is very mediocre.

Location is good, next to a big mall and also the convention center. If not for event s at convention center would probably not come back here.",3206
21,ChIJLVt6f0FB0i0Rp_5Oey50FTs,HARRIS Hotel Kuta Galleria - Bali,Xeon,2,"I stayed only 1 night and I have to say it is one of the loudest hotels I have stayed at. It's not even the traffic or outside noise that is so noticeable, but everything inside the hotel. It starts with the door to my room having zero isolation. I could literally hear kids running across the hallway barefoot, not even mentioning people with flip-flops or high heels. I had a room towards the back of the hotel, so I was facing a more quiet area, but again the window doesn't seem to be isolated at all. I woke up to 2 people having a simple conversation on the balcony next to me, where I could understand every single word they're saying even though my doors were closed. I am a very deep sleeper and usually don't wake up to simple things like this, but here I couldn't sleep very well.

The room itself is great, spacious bathroom, a couch. Also very clean and modern. I also like that it is very dark if the curtains are closed, perfect for sleeping (if it wasn't so noisy).",5074

When i ask blanket they just give something like cloth.

Last day i stay this hotel when i wanna extend, the crew say i can guarante with the KTP only but when i come to receptionis, They say cannot and must pay immedietly, i think the tim is not have a unity and bad communication.

One more drama when i stay there, after i pay last night, i wanna go to breakfast with my wife, when we take the food, the crew come and stay we just room only, thats the part make us angry,

Building is falling to bits. Almost no landscape effort is made (weeds everywhere, trees and plants left unpruned) the rooms are quite nice however, our shower had a fair chunk of mould! 5 star hotel is laughable. Staff are quite abrupt and rude. The bartender that served us last night made us feel more like a burden than a paying guest.

I would not comeback and I would not recommend it to anyone. A massive waste of time and money. 3 star hotels in central Kuta are better kept and friendlier.",976

The territory and pool was very good room seemed spacious and clean. But after a week there things started to get worse and worse. At first I was waken up by some noise. Something was running in my ceiling after I heard squeaky noise from there. I called reception and in about 40!! Minutes staff came and said to me that there is rats. I was shocked (because it‚Äôs a five hotel) but they very very calm like it was something very usual for them. After few days my A/C started to smell disgusting I called the receptions 3 times and left the room because I can‚Äôt stay any longer. When I return to my room in the evening it smells even worse then I came to reception to ask them what‚Äôs going on and they told me that no one came to my room, so they just don‚Äôt give any attention to this. I told them that it is inappropriate and showed the video of the rats noise and smell in the room asking for returning my money or least giving some discount. All they tell me is if you don‚Äôt have a photo of the rat on my room they can‚Äôt help me!!! I ve never been in such awful hotel. The territory is pretty good and pools also but service and everything else was absolutely awful.

The beach is a bit further but the walk is still doable.
The staff is incredible. Everyone was very friendly and the hostesses did everything to help us. I was also impressed by the kitchen staff.

We stayed in a grand deluxe villa with a private pool. I will say that the cleanliness of the hotel is as clean as they can make it with their daily cleaning. Though the room, pool and bathroom was quite worn and was noticeably in need of renovation. The shower head needed to be replaced desperately.

The pool was quite green on the edges of the stone but we swam in it throughout the trip and had no issues.

Mosiqutoes are managed by the staff spraying household pesticide sprays once every couple of days. The mosquito net around the bed was stiff and couldn't really be used easily. Probably had 2 bites in the week I was there, so no issue.

The bed was hard, but surprisingly it was quite comfortable.

- fruits
- Pancakes
- Fried egg on request
- Toast, butter, jam

I had to borrow a bowl and request a few plastic utensils for use in my room and the crew were more than willing to assist. The buffet breakfast exceeded my expectations as well.

Location was more than ok in my opinion, lots of stores and food options around the area.  Money exchanges and spas were also within walking distance.

The hotel itself was kind of fair, hotel facade and drop off brings good vibes. I think we had a very basic room. Bathroom was ok, fairly standard. Only downside for me was the bed. It was comfy but I'm not 100% if it was thoroughly cleaned. I could smell something in my pillow I had to spray alcohol all over to it and to the bed just to disinfect my doubts of cleanliness. Beside that, overall pleasant stay. Nice pool area, but wasn't able to hop into it.",2884

Lucky we were only there for one night.
Breakfast was included and it was fantastic, surprisingly. A buffet brekkie with a few hot meals (Balinese, not western), but also toast and juice, it was excellent and really good value. I guess at the end of the day this place is not a bad option for Kuta, especially if you want to be near the airport (it was less than 10 minutes) but I would highly recommend they improve the bathroom situation, as it could have been a much more pleasant stay.",5646

The hotel was also near all the seafood by the beach. Breakfast was not bad.

Cons: When we first got our room, there were 4 big flies inside + ants in the bed which was not ideal at all in terms of hygiene. So we kindly requested to change the room, which was accommodated by the hotel.
On our second day of stay, we have put up a 'please make up room' sign after we have finished our breakfast and left the hotel. However, when we came back in the evening, the room was still in the same state - not made up at all with the 'please make up room' sign still on. It was quite disappointing, since we didn't have a great first impression already. When we highlighted this, the staff was quite resistant at first. A change of room was initiated however, there was a cockroach in front of the room that was proposed, so we just requested them to clean the current room we stayed in.

Overall, we are disappointed to have this experience for a 4-stars hotel. Service could have been better, especially on hygiene.
Not keen to stay here again should there be no changes :/",3415

The room (1618) is okay, comfortable bed, hairdryer available. Just that the water at the sink is a bit salty and when I turn it on, it goes from cold to hot and I can't adjust it somehow. It's convenient for events because of the halls available and the ballroom for the SEACSO + GELOSEA competitions. Other than that, I requested for an iron and managed to get it a day after only to find it broken (it cannot be heated up). Other than that, the socket's screws got loosr after removing the iron's plug.

Another good thing: the food. No regrets and I love it so much. They have buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner and there's a variety of food available. Room service is okay too, the staff is friendly even though it takes time for them to understand English. The location is strategic too I believe.

One more thing: bring an European plug since the room uses that most of the time (there's one socket for the one that's common in Malaysia too so don't worry much unless you're sharing a room like me)

If you want to enjoy the pool you need to wake up early, the sunbeds next to the pool have sun only until 10:30, for the sun moving in the sky you will have shadow on half pool starting from 11:30am.

The hotel is located in a street that is narrow and with no shops, however there PLENTY of shops/restaurant/massage on the parallel, the street where the hotel is located is also a bit dangerous to walk at late evening as is seriously narrow and there's a lot of scooters and car coming and going.

For my experience the WiFi connection is reliable and fast, good from doing some WFH too.

Overall is a nice hotel located in Kuta and not far from activities and beach, for 2adults I've paid a total of ¬£13 at night with breakfast included, I'll not value this hotel more than that, however I'll probably not book again this place.",3011

We used the restaurant area many times as there was always a nice atmosphere and the food didn't disappoint. The only downside is that the rooms are a bit dated (but great value for the price we paid), and in our 2-bed apartment the air conditioning just did not keep the rooms cool enough.  The Haven is in the process of being updated however and new rooms will have better air con units. Aside from this we loved our stay and would come back again.",3204

First of all, my room was not ready until 3 p.m. Then they gave me a room which I will not even put my dog in there. Room was full of molds and mildew, cracked tiles and disgusting washroom. The room beside is under renovation, the hallway was full of dust and noisy. Immediately, I went to the reception and complained with video and pictures I took. The reception was pleasant and tried to show me another room which is not any better. I showed her the mold in the rooms are unsanitary and bad for health. She apologized and went back to reception and spoke with her manager. Then, she took me to a much better room. Still have mildew in the shower but not as bad as the other room. I guess they don't know how to control mold and mildew. I settled with this room because at least it's much better than the other ones.

Breakfast was nice with a lot of variety compared to the other hotels. Swimming pool and ground keeping was also very nice. It takes a while to get the hot water to get it warm in the shower. Drainage in the shower has a bit of sewage smell.

All the staffs are super friendly and very pleasant. If the hotel wants to improve their rating, they should not put the guests in the run down and disgusting rooms. I really hope that they will improve their cleaning.

The location was great as walking distance to beach, shopping and restaurants.

The staffs at the restaurant and reception deserve the recognition for their services. You can see the difference in rooms before and after I complained in the pictures.",2935

The hotel is cleaned every day, they bring water, hygiene products (shampoo, gel, etc.). The room has slippers and a safe. The hotel has an excellent rooftop pool, where there are almost no people, and there is also a bar on the terrace. There is a large lobby with books at the bottom of the hotel. Wi-Fi in the hotel works great. The staff is polite and friendly. Breakfast at the hotel is in the form of a buffet, not very varied, but there is plenty to choose from.
I did not like that there is very little space in the room, literally not to turn around. In the room, the entrance to the shower and toilet is closed with a frosted glass wall, but there is no sound insulation. In general, the sound insulation in the hotel is not very good.

The hotel looks very impressive from the outside and in the lounge,  but that's about it.

There was no refrigerator to keep drinking stuff cool, no safe lock box to store travel documents, no hair dryer in the bathroom (for my wife!), no electrical outlets and very poor lighting in the bathroom with just one little light over the toilet, marginal wifi network with poor connection dropping in and out about 50% of the time, and finally no telephone in the room which makes it very difficult to communicate with other friends in different rooms or call the front desk to request anything.

The breakfast room is a huge and nice buffet room enclosed by the stylish see-through clear glass walls, but full of flies in the morning.

Housekeeping staff and front office were great I spoke with Tini most of the cases or request during my stay; unfortunately not so much with the restaurant staff. I found finger prints visible in most of the mirrors or unused tv screen right above  steamed rice and (already cook and dry) omelet station for the whole 7days. Probably the restaurant staff can be more attentive towards their cleanliness considering your hotel I supposed is 4 starts Hotel. Second day breakfast I had to request for sour dough (bread) cause there wasn‚Äôt any available even though butter and jam displayed, the answer from the staff after checking with the chef was just WE DON‚ÄôT HAVE !! Like really‚Ä¶
Salad was always not fresh, cherry tomatoes overripe and fruit flies seen on top of it. You could do better chef. Not much of an option of pastries either.

Basic facilities in the room such as hairdryer ,iron table etc were only provide upon request which was strange for me. No safety box and fridge available either.
Kindly note that my basic knowledge and business orientation is in hospitality industry too. I‚Äôm working on bringing more tourists from Dubai to Bali for the next 5 years.

This should be an easy 5-star resort.

Considering the resort touts itself as being tranquil and relaxing, it was just the opposite with extremely loud music coming from the private party that took over the whole restaurant. So we were forced to have a limited selection at the pool restaurant.

For me, the lack of a variety of food offered in the restaurant was the last straw for me.  When I am forced to go off hotel properties to get quality food at a reasonable price, you lost a customer.

Look at available menu items and pricing before you book this location.

Don't forget to add on 21% tax and the resort fees onto your meal as well.

Be sure to follow and like my reviews. I don't get paid or accept any type of payment for my reviews.

When contacted the personal they moved is to another room in better conditions. The infinite pool is gorgeous and I couldn't stand in the deeper part (I am  1.81 ~ 6').

The views are gorgeous, and spotted a lot of animals during the stay. The massage was extremely relaxing, one of the best i have taken, but I am not an expert).

Need a cheap option this time because arriving midnight. So choose this hotel . Have been reading some negative  reviews here , so I'm prepared for the woest

This hotel is Now a limited amenities hotel. U need to pay RP10K for the towel . The towel smells fresh, but it's already turn from white to brown. So if you're particular, bring your own towel

They also provide kettle and hairdryer upon request. But all 3 kettles I got and exchanged are in bad conditions (heating plate has turn black or thick grey stains on the surface )  so I ended up not using them, did not want to risk my health drinking the water from the kettle  , and the hairdryer provided was only 400w. It's suitable for baby or drying your pubic hair, lol. If you have thick, long hair, it will probably take 1 hour to dry the hair .

The bed is comfortable,  AC is cold , wifi is strong, and the shower is reasonable pressure with stable hot water supply.  Walls paper starting to peel off , wall has  mould , building lift not working etc

It is such a pity that the conditions of the hotel has been worsened after the pandemic and the management are not putting any effort maintaining it . Staff are really friendly and accommodating but they can't help much to solve the problem

We had to drag ourselves to knock on the neighbor's door to ask them to keep it down-it was around 4am when this happened.

The breakfast was a disaster. There is not much option if you don¬¥t like indonesian food. More than 20 minutes wait for an omelette.
The staff was not nice. They delayed my check-in more than 1 hour, and when I got the room I noticed a very annoying noise outside of the room as the A/C was just there. I asked if they could change my room and they not even bothered to help me.
The swimming pool area was in the middle of the hotel, so every person that goes into the hotel sees you. There is no privacy.
When I got back from dinner the first night, the entrance of the hotel was full of rubbish.
Additionally, the hotel is located in a very noise road.",250

We made the mistake of staying here the night before our flight and was kept up by the sheer volume of a party they hold weekly (wasn't aware of this when booking). I'm not even a light sleeper but the noise was unnecessarily loud, the music was loud but the bloody microphone they had was even louder and it echos throughout the whole hotel as the central part is open plan. The rooms looked nothing like on their pictures it was so dirty, the bathroom was awful full of grout. The loungers were also filthy. Aircon wasn't great and service wasn't great. Also found it gross they don't supply hand-wash in the bathrooms even though there's advertisement throughout the hotel about hand-washing etc post covid.

Definitely not 4* hotel standards",1580

220,ChIJWa9i8bJG0i0RW_BRN0l18zU,Mega Boutique,Monica Verdiana,1,"The hotel is a bit dated and run down, but it‚Äôs kept overall clean and tidy.
Unfortunately I cannot say the same about the designated breakfast area.
The area is dirty, messy, left empty and unattended with ants everywhere.
The first morning I went to have breakfast at 8.45; all the hot plates were empty, the dining plates were dirty with old food stuck to them, the coffe area was packed with empty sachets of sugar, full of ants, no more coffee or tea or butter or jam.
The staff was in the kitchen on their mobile phones.

I complained with the front desk to find exactly the same situation the day after.

The prawn crackers were old and stale, the water in the water dispenser hadn‚Äôt been changed or refilled for 3 days.
I asked one of the staff to replenish the jam and when I spread it onto the bread it was full of what it appeared to be rat droppings.
I asked the staff member to find out what it was and he never came back to me.

The poor quality of the breakfast service is putting the health of the guests at risk; they should be ashamed.
The level of care and cleanliness is appalling; in Bali is  easy enough to catch Bali belly but this hotel puts guests at high risk of contracting much more dangerous illnesses.

For this reason I will never stay in this  hotel again nor I will recommend it to any of my family and friends.

The front desk facility is run very professionally with helpful and attentive staff.",3272

225,ChIJdSaVLr1F0i0R2w93KaSDqiY,Royal Tulip Springhill Resort Jimbaran,M. Tegar,3,"In February 2023, I had the chance to stay for three nights at the Royal Tulip Springhill in Jimbaran, Bali. The experience was a mixed bag; there were definite highlights, but a few points fell short of my expectations.

Starting with the less pleasing points, the location of the hotel was not as convenient as I had hoped. It's situated far from the main road and the access gets pretty dark at night, which might not appeal to those without personal transportation. The area does not lend itself to easy walks or strolls, so having your vehicle is a must for getting around.

My stay was marred slightly by an issue with the room's air conditioning unit, which was not cooling efficiently upon my arrival, and later that night, it unexpectedly shut off. However, credit where it's due, the hotel staff were quick to respond and rectify the problem even when I called them late at 11 pm.

In terms of accommodation, the room and its furnishings seemed slightly dated and showed signs of wear. While cleanliness was decently maintained, the attention to detail was less than impressive when my room was serviced, which left some room for improvement.

Now, onto the bright side of my stay. The hotel, particularly the deluxe room, offers impressive value for money. When compared to other facilities in Bali, the pricing at the Royal Tulip Springhill was quite competitive, making it an excellent choice for budget-conscious travellers.

Breakfast was another strong point during my stay. The hotel provided an ample variety of options, catering to diverse palates, and I was impressed with the overall quality of the food.

The hotel facilities and recreational areas, including the pool, were also noteworthy. They contributed to making my stay more enjoyable and relaxing.

In summary, despite a few hiccups, the Royal Tulip Springhill in Jimbaran can be a decent choice for budget travellers who prioritize value for money and can overlook some minor inconveniences.",2946
226,ChIJdSaVLr1F0i0R2w93KaSDqiY,Royal Tulip Springhill Resort Jimbaran,Alexey Novgorodov,5,"Very green and quiet location, like living in a forest. To get to the beach you need to call a taxi, thankfully it is quick and inexpensive. Rooms are a little old and creaky. We had some problems with plumbing, however it didn't spoil our stay.

227,ChIJdSaVLr1F0i0R2w93KaSDqiY,Royal Tulip Springhill Resort Jimbaran,Russel Shaw,2,"I‚Äôm not sure why this hotel has a 5-star rating. It‚Äôs in a pretty good location being close to the airport, beach, and some restaurants.

I booked this place mainly for its proximity to the airport as it was our last stay before going home.
I was counting on its ‚Äú5-star rating‚Äù as some assurance that my stay would be restful and pleasant. However there were a number of negative factors that made my stay less than 5 stars.

The room was spacious but dated. The AC was dripping water on the floor and no cool air was coming out. I asked the front desk to take a look at it and it worked a little better but still dripped. The safe did not work‚Äîneeding batteries, and I asked three times to have it fixed, but it is still was repaired up to the time I checked out. Also, I want to mention the ants crawling up the wall behind the refrigerator.

The buffet breakfast was ok, but inconsistent in its offerings and no bacon. The breakfast area seemed to be a popular place for drivers to have a coffee and innumerable cigarettes totally disregarding the small children and guests sitting at tables beside them.

The pool area is treacherous to walk on having tripped myself and then watching a child fall as well on the strangely paved pool surrounding. There were not many pool chairs and many of them broken.

We stopped by the restaurant to have a something soothing to our stomachs but was told their mixer was broken.

I think this rating should be examined and the problems rectified.",4240

229,ChIJdSaVLr1F0i0R2w93KaSDqiY,Royal Tulip Springhill Resort Jimbaran,ROHIT KUMAR,3,"Contradictory service commitment. One day they say something is free in breakfast and the next day they say it isn't.

Breakfast meal boxes were of good quality and quantity on the first day and 2 days later it was very different.

They assume eggs are allowed in pure vegetarian food by default, you have to tell them to provide veg food without eggs. They made us eat eggs in vegetarian food. Although, it can be acceptable due to cultural differences.

Breakfast buffet is a total waste of money if you are vegetarian. They have only 2-3 similar dishes everyday.

We once ordered a few things, we asked for the total amount to be paid on phone. When they sent bill they added addition charges on the name of side dish. Why didn't they tell it when we asked while ordering?

Private Pool in villa is average different from photos. The area surrounding the pool looks old.

Safe was also not working.

Furthermore, this hotel allows us to leave our luggage at the concierge and have it delivered to the room when it is ready.

I liked the thick towels, and the bedsheet was quite new.

Almost half of the lights in my room didn't work, but the main ones did, and the rest would be easy to fix if you are staying longer.

The room is probably meant for longer stays, because despite having a sink, fridge and gas stove, there were absolutely no cooking/eating/drinking utensils.

I recently stayed at the Terrace at Kuta Hotel with my family and overall, we had a pleasant experience. The room was clean and tidy, which is always a plus. However, there were a few drawbacks that I noticed during our stay.

Firstly, the parking lot at the hotel is quite small, so it was difficult to find a spot for our car. This could be inconvenient for guests who are driving.

Secondly, the water flow in the shower was quite low, which made it difficult to take a proper shower. This was a minor inconvenience, but it did detract from our overall experience.

On the positive side, the standard room size was just right for our needs. We booked two rooms for our family and requested connecting rooms, which was a great option for us. The connecting rooms were very nice and made our stay more comfortable.

Overall, I would recommend the Terrace Hotel for its clean and tidy rooms and the option of connecting rooms for families. However, the small parking lot and low water flow in the shower were minor drawbacks that could be improved upon.",4638

No hello or welcome. The staff just staring at us rudely making us feel incredibly unwelcome. After check in, we saw the pool which was cloudy (a sign of unbalanced chemicals and high chlorine) so we decided to speak to the manager regarding checking out early. The manager named Ketut (I doubt he was actually the highest manager there based on his attitude) was rude and useless, he came up to me ready for an argument before I even opened my mouth. He didn‚Äôt let me voice my concerns instead smiling and laughing at me saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay it‚Äôs okay you can check out and leave now‚Äù .. we booked and paid this hotel more than 1 month ago so it is not okay to arrive and be treated like this. I asked if we could take a few minutes to get out stuff and gather our thoughts however Ketut told us we needed to leave? No apology, no chance to speak about our concerns or provide feedback.

Worst service I‚Äôve ever experienced in Indonesia. Ketut should be ashamed, how he became a manager (probably paid the right people) I will never understand.

The gardens and rooms are spectacular and the people are so friendly and lovely. Thank you to Nandi, Made, Wardu and the team for making our stay so memorable. Highly recommended. We loved being in the Amitara - which is a short walk from where the villas and restaurant are. Wardu took us back and forth in the golf buggy whenever we wanted to go to the restaurant.

The tours they provide are quite relaxing and they're flexible on where to go. The pool is very nice and the rooms are even better. I would stay here again and recommend to people looking for a place they can use English. The place is tucked away from the main road and it's quiet, you don't hear the traffic at all. There is a cool little cat that demands a pat now and then,  which is perfect fine. The food is not amazing for what you pay,  but there is not much else around so you're paying for the convenience. No scooter hire here. Convenience store around the corner (30 seconds) or cocomart is 24hrs which is a 5 minute walk away. Overall very good!",3506

266,ChIJsVzexcRG0i0R0pCAjEvzHHs,Pelangi Bali Hotel & Spa,martin redgrave,4,Good hotel in the semimyak area. Just off the main street. Great location and opposite the beach. Good pool and rooms are a good size. Prices are obviously more expensive than if you go elsewhere. There's a convenience store just opposite the entrance. Be aware of staff wanting tips and being kind of rude when given 20 000... As if they expect a lot more.,5684
267,ChIJsVzexcRG0i0R0pCAjEvzHHs,Pelangi Bali Hotel & Spa,Mark,4,"Service was 5 stars. All the staff are incredible friendly and helpful, was the highlight of the stay. We also were delayed an entire day due to Jetstar (who else) however the Hotel graciously pushed out entire 7-night stay back a whole day at no extra cost. This was above and beyond and much appreciated!

The location was great if you're in Bali for beach vibes. The hotel is located right on the beach with a plethora of beach bars nearby. We hired a scooter so could easily travel north/south to inland restaurants, but if you're not comfortable doing that and don't want to pay for taxis to get around, you might want to stay more north or south to have more options in walking distance. Oh and there's also a convenience store (think 7-eleven) right out the front of the hotel so you can stock up on water, snacks, and alcohol easily if that's important to you.

The food was fine, but nothing special. I would recommend eating out in Bali and trying restaurants instead, but the few times we are the food was good but not great.

The room was fine for what we paid, nice big shower, bed was a bit firm but fine. A decent mix of TV channels to choose from and entering the room with aircon after a hot day in Bali was always very satisfying.

Nitpicking: the music at breakfast was often one or two songs on repeat and it got quite irritating after several days.

Overall a very pleasant stay, and for the price it would be hard to beat. The amazing staff made the stay what it was, and I do recommend it.",3053

The rooms are on the smaller side but for the price, they have everything you need and the bed is so comfortable! It was a tad noisy due to it being in the heart of Legian on a busy street but they provide earplugs if you need them and after that I slept like a baby.

The rooms are very small but suitable for me. There is only a small hanging place with no storage drawers.  I had to ask for 10 hangers! I have been staying for over two  weeks whereas the majority of people only stay for a few days
The bad side is that it is incredibly noisy as the traffic is constant, especially the motor bikes, but I have the best ear plugs and slept like a baby as the noise was blocked out completely.
I strongly recommend you take ear plugs.
I highly recommend it as it is very cheap and cleaned daily.
Breakfast is cheap, too, even though I didn't include it in my price. I didn't have breakfast every day there. The lunch is pretty good and cheap too but the restaurant is only open until 4.0 pm.",1299

The bed had nice cushioning and always clean and tidy as the staff made it up everyday during my stay. Another interesting part of the room is the availability of small window that connects with vertical garden inside the hotel building. This view in someway make me feel like staying inside a giant aquarium, very unique! I will recommend everyone who plans to stay in Kuta and Legian area to stay in this hotel.

Since we were there for awhile, we wanted to dry our swimsuits and it was really nice that the room had plenty of hangers and our balcony had a bar for us to hang a few items. We also rented a scooter from them for a day, definitely worth it to get around Canggu. We loved everything about this place and couldn't bear to leave. Will definitely be back!",2413
276,ChIJXdu3inc40i0R-VVLM798MjY,Eastin Ashta Resort,Hendrick Lai,5,"We had a lovely stay at the Eastin Ashta Resort for our first stop in Bali from Melbourne.
*March of 2023*

The Good:

1. Location was probably the best thing about this place if you're looking to experience Canggu. Close to the beach but also close to plenty of shops, great food and tucked away just far away enough.

2. Staff and service was lovely. They always greeted dus with a smile, helpful with servicing our air conditioning, helping us with getting a doctor for Bali Belly and more.

3. The room was great. Spacious and comfortable, with a huge bed to boot. TV, AC, a good shower and a balcony. No complains here.

4. Breakfast had a good spread of east / west, good service and changed things up every day. Food wasn't too bad.

5. Amenities. Lots of great things, like a gym, pool, towel service, massages in rooms, restaurant etc.

6. Clean. As a whistle, lots of staff and everything was tidy.

Things to Improve:

1. I wish the staff had more knowledge of the area to give us a better idea of what to do/see.

2. The noise was bad. The area is surrounded by construction (unfortunately) as of March 2023 and there wasn't great soundproofing. It made it hard to relax there.

3. The shade by the pool kind of sucked. The umbrellas were never in a good position for any time of the day so we were always under the sun.

Overall though, it was a pleasant hotel stay in Bali.",2092

Rooms are perfect and exactly what you need.

Staff are amazing, polite and always happy to help.

Good buffet in the morning

Pool bar is a little bit expensive but the food is delicious none the less.

Due to the growth of the local area, yes there is some construction around and you hear it from 8am till 8pm. The resort do their best and it‚Äôs not their fault, they sent security over for us immediately one night as they were working a bit later but honestly it‚Äôs not a big deal and you hardly hear it whilst your enjoying a drink by the pool during the day and it doesn‚Äôt wake you up in the mornings either.",1227

The rooms are v clean and well maintained. They have all the necessary amenities including a good Philips hair dryer so you don't ruin your hair. They provide buggy service from main gate to rooms area which is good.

Overall I think what makes me want to come back here is the service from all the staff. They are so lovely, going above and beyond at every step to make you comfortable.

Breakfast at the asparagus restaurant is good. They have Indonesian food, egg station and a good selection of western dishes.
Arif at the restaurant is v lovely and will offer tasters of various teas if you dine there.

The hotel is set back from the main road, all spotlessly clean, the staff are so helpful and always say hello.  The pool area is beautiful, the water is delightfully cool but not cold, so refreshing after a day out!

It was the worst night I've ever had to stay awake because my whole body was itchy with dirt.

I The next morning I asked to cancel booking with the hotel with the remaining two nights, they said ok and ask me to cancel on the app.

I thought they meant okay so I checked out and went to the pharmacy to buy medicine for itching. (My whole face is still itchy).

After contacting the application and they sent an email to the hotel and said I can contact the hotel and ask them to reply to that Email.

I called the hotel They said they would reply right away AND in the end I got a EMAIL from Agoda  to inform that they won't return the money because it's based on policy.

You should go to this hotel.

Although the building is built on 1985, but it's well maintained, clean and spacious.

Pak Budi, the operation manager for the hotel, helps your request, and he has lots of story about Bali and its tradition.

The furniture is OK, and the bed is comfy.

Aircon, and bathroom is OK.

Pool is not big, but has kids and adults space that's quite ideal for up to 20 people, IMHO.

I would‚Äôve given 5 star if it weren‚Äôt for the spring bed üòÖ please put extra bed topper, we could feel the metal springs.
But above all, we had a wonderful stay here, thank you!

There was no air-condition in the lobby, odd, but we didn‚Äôt think much of it. But it keeps getting worse. Everything seems very run down and not maintained well. Rooms feel not clean and have a damp smell. Beds are suspiciously stained and also damp-ish when we arrive. Floors are humid and slippery. Toilet mats are old and moldy. There are insects and lizards. Soundproof is poor, we could hear word by word what our neighbors are arguing about in their balcony even with our doors and curtains all closed.

The only good things are the location, the size of the room (pretty spacious, you can do yoga inside), and the reception staff seems nice and friendly.

Yes, the price is cheap, we didn‚Äôt expect fancy amenities or unlimited breakfast spread. But at the very least, we expect cleanliness from a 4-star hotel.",4538

Lobby has no AC but that's fine I guess. Pool is great. However I have several complains:
1. No face towels (I asked housekeeping to send them to the room but they never did)
2. Can't ask for extra bath towels (two per room and that's it)
3. The walls are too thin that we practically could hear the people next to our room when they talked and played a little music",4570

It is located in Kuta, not far from beach coasts and absolutely not far from malls and other facilities. Service was top knot and the breakfast is very good. There was a daily clean-up of our rooms in the mornings. If you are anxious about leaving any of your belongings in the room while they clean-up, don't worry because you can trust these guys. But I would still recommend to keep the cash and expensive items with you at all times. On our last day there, there was a bit of inconvinience about the smell that the mini fridge caused and they didn't let us stay there. Instead they gave us an upgrade to a suite.

Well located with many food shops and transmart located nearby.

Overall the hotel is getting a bit tired so a bit of attention to some maintenance wouldn't go amiss.

I thought that the parking was amusing
The sign says that there are 143 rooms.
There are about 10 car spaces in front .
Management and staff occupied at least half of the available parking space....
And paying customers had to park down the road in another space..
So you had to walk about 40 metres back to the hotel.

The location is just perfect, within 5 mins walking distance from Jimbaran beach, one can watch a beautiful sunset every evening. With lots of open spaces, it was a relief as we had a kid who loves to run around.

The food at the hotel's restaurant was delicious, with a decent selection of Balinese and international dishes to choose from. The staff were attentive and always happy to make recommendations. The breakfast selection was just perfect, with a wide variety of options to suit everyone's taste.

The hotel's facilities were good and well-maintained, including the pool and open spaces. we had a wonderful time relaxing by the pool and soaking the sun. There are 3 pools, so one can never get bored of taking a dip.

There are so many magical moments of bliss and beauty thoughtfully integrated into the resorts layout. Gorgeous fountains and peaceful gardens to enjoy in every corner.

I took smaller bag with me.  Next we asked to cancel evening massage due to sunburn, sorry can't be done!!! At 11 am you can't cancel 8 pm massage? (massage was good BTW).  Next we asked if they can help rent motorbikes - sorry all are out today. We went to village 5 min later we found a plenty  of bikes for rent. That start left a very bad taste for me. Grounds are nice and well maintained. Views with rice fields and mountains are beautiful. Sideman is a very poor area. Not much else to do.  We stayed in 4 hotels in Bali, with so many great places, I would put my money somewhere else next time.
Update -- I have to lower my review. After day with hotel food and drinks most of our group of 8 got sick, some violently with diarrhea and vomiting. Do yourself a favor STAY AWAY.",415

Samanvaya has been the most wonderful resort in which we have been - not only in this holidays, but surely in our lives.

Everything here is magic, every detail is taken care of. You will find Balinese style in each corner. Views are amazing.

The restaurant offers really good food. You will be able to find healthy food, western food, Indonesian food.. And the breakfast is super yummy.

They also have a spa with such nice treatments. We did one and it was absolutely perfect.

And last but not least, the staff is wonderful. They are super caring and they are always smiling. They are very proactive, so attentive to make you feel at home.

If I have the chance to get back to Bali, I will stay here with no doubts. I highly recommend this heaven-on-earth :)",3084

The staff is remarkably polite and efficient, always going above and beyond to cater to your requests. You cannot help but be impressed by their unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction.

It's clear that the owner has done an outstanding job in creating an environment that fosters exceptional service, and the team at Samanvaya Bali is a testament to this.

The Sundari room is nice but not really the 4* worth, awkward place for the kettle to make some tea; no ‚Äúfree bees‚Äù, a bit bare in comparison to the other 4* hotels we stayed during this trip; I suppose the area is unique so definitely worth it, breakfast, dinner was fabulous and the staff friendly however at cocktail hour hard to find them around. Some strange mobile phone is at your disposal but if you are not familiar with that brand using it takes a lot of effort and time, which is unnecessary.

The second room we were given was not much better, blood on one pillow, brown stains on another.  The toilet seat was another experience.  See the pictures for yourself.  We left after being offered a third room but we were told the rooms were non refundable.  A very expensive mistake for the hotel management to make.  This is the dirtiest hotel I have ever been to.

Rooms are very spacious and having a bath was part of the reason for my booking and would help me with my recovery. Staff all very good and its great value for money.
But.
My first night my room was right up the back where for some reasone they decided the hallway lights didnt need to be on. I needed to use my phone torch to access my room. I was also situated right next to some very loud construction room. While they didnt start too early or late it was right outside my balcony and very loud.
There was no issue requesting a room change.
Hot water is only on sometimes and I had a plumbing issue that was very quickly resolved by maintenance.
My biggest issue with my stay was the alarm the doors make when they dont close properly. All through the night and early morning I was kept awake by these alarms going off. I did close some doors incase some one has left and accidentally left their door open but the alarms continued all through the nights and ealry mornings making it impossible to sleep while people are moving about.

Still great value for money and location and certainly beats stay at the hospital. But I wont be back.",5073

Everyday is the repeated the same menu. I wish the hotel served more variety or buffet style breakfast. Served more local food instead of focusing on western menu. Tourist come to Bali to enjoyed the cultures and also the food. If the hotel can give the traditional and cultures to tourist, it's also can be done by introducing more local foods to guess.

The resort also offers a range of activities and amenities, including a beautiful swimming pool, a spa, and a restaurant serving delicious local and international cuisine. I particularly enjoyed taking a sunrise boat trip to see the dolphins, which was organized by the resort and was a truly unforgettable experience.

This is one of my worst experiences in staying at a hotel in Bali. There was a pool and garden in front of my room, I stayed on the 5th floor which was the highest floor in the hotel. There were back to back night events in the pool area at night, and the noise was crazy, truly crazy, people shouted at night (even at 10-11pm at night). Yes, you read that right. The hotel didn't have any noise policy.

If you want a relaxing stay in Bali, PLEASE AVOID THIS HOTEL. It didn't feel like a hotel at all, the noise was like in a music festival, traditional market with people shouting.

Although the location is great, but the noise really made this hotel an unpleasant stay. Note that the interior and appliances are outdated as well.

Top-notch friendly Balinese hospitality, every staff is professional and kind. I had to call the front desk to send someone up to collect my cooler ice packs and expressed milk for baby yo put them in their freezer and they always did it with a smile. They also provided a complimentary slice of carrot cake for my son‚Äôs birthday which was delicious.

Wide array of breakfast choices. Huge toilet in the room, with a private jacuzzi and day bed in the balcony. Television with many channels.

Huge swimming pool, with an area of ‚Äòfake beach‚Äô, making it perfect for families with young children as it‚Äôs much safer and cleaner than going out to the real beach (that‚Äôs definitely an option but you can easily rest under the decked chairs if the kids need a respite from the heat).

Each day, the resort has different activities for kids such as face painting, yoga, movie night by the pool‚Ä¶ the kids club room is a little sad when we went there‚Ä¶ checked it out with my three year old but we found that the toys were in a mess/broken‚Ä¶ would be nice if they had an indoor playground with a ball pit where the parents can leave the kids to be engaged for a longer period of time (hence one star off).

The room did need a bit of a clean though, some corners hadn't been cleaned for a while and there was a bit of mold in the bathroom.. outside of our room, the seiling had some serious water damage and leaked from time to time.

476,ChIJYcnObW9D0i0R5QwHP1eh7j8,The Lerina Hotel Nusa Dua - Bali,Florian Laur,4,"Overall, I enjoyed my stay very much, despite a few flaws.

The negatives first:
WiFi wasn't good on the third floor, I often couldn't access sites or messages. Some receivers would help.
The sink in the bathroom were all askew, it makes it a bit difficult for water to drain properly.
The doors are all a bit difficult to shut, seems that the salty sea air warped the doors?
Indosiar didn't work on my tv. Maybe don't put it on the list if it doesn't work, it made me miss the Japanese Worldcup Match.
For a 4 star hotel, the facilities, although good, seemed more like 3-3,5 stars.

The good:
The staff is definitely very good and made me feel very welcome.
The pool, although getting up there in years was nice, at least for me.
The beds are comfy, the rooms are very clean and housekeeping does a very good job!
The location is good and considering the price, it's definitely a hotel I would recommend, it's offering a decent value for your money.",1812

The hotel is not new but it is quite well maintained.  At the time of my check in on 24 August 2022, the receptionist told me only the ground floor and 1st floor rooms are opened for booking.  So I asked for the room at higher level.  I was given room 203, balcony facing pool and door facing a temple.  Which suits me well.
I would suggest to the hotel management to touch up the heavily water stained wall and clean the dark stain on the bath tub.

But I decided to give lower rating this time, because I want to give a honest feedback. I hope, that next time it will be better and I will give 5* again. The servis was so slow and sometime times there wasn‚Äôt any servis at all. Don‚Äôt take me wrong, I love the people, who works there, they were so kind, but if you are siting in the restaurant and nobody is even ask you, if you need something, it‚Äôs just not good. Sometimes, we waited just for a soda can 15 minutes and we have to remind (we were there just the only gusts there - definitely not busy), or next time we didn‚Äôt even received the full order. Waiting times for breakfast or food was extremely long. BUT I have to say, that the food was so tasty!

My conclusion? It‚Äôs definitely a great hotel with super value/money ratio, the rooms are nice, the staff is really kind, the location was for us perfect (calm place, but close to Ubud center), BUT I think, that there should be at least one more staff member. That can change a lot. Please improve that and we will definitely comeback.",3091

The structure is modern, the rooms are very nicely placed and the only sounds we hear are the ones of birds chirping. the bathroom was big and clean, the rooms was nice and cozy, the beds were amazing and came with 4 soft pillows! (You can ask them to change it, they have a selection of them). Want your room cleaned up after the hour of room cleaning? Just click on a button and they'll come clean it. Don't want them to come? press on another button (do not disturb). The buttons are located outside and inside next to the door. Next, the pools were great, you can lay down on some type of sofas they have. Next of all, the restaurant! 50‚ÑÖ happy hours and free Indonesian afternoon tea where you get to eat traditional snacks (along with tea and Popcorn). The restaurant's good is tasty and amazing! You can eat in your room and even order from the other restaurants (tree bar, kuu which is the Japanese restaurant of the hotel and another one.) Just click on a button on the phone and call who you want! in room dining, lobby, spa and room service.
If you don't want to get the pack with the breakfast or dinner, not to worry! it's amazingly well placed and you can walk by the beach or go to the streets filled with nice restaurants and cafes. The price is totally worth it. Not to mention all the complementary stuff (Indonesian afternoon tea where you get to eat traditional snacks along with tea and Popcorn, yoga classes..)
There are some extra activities that you have to pay for, but that are great as well! I totally recommend 100%, trust me you won't regret it :)",4517

The location is superb with Beachwalk adjacent, 6pm sunset time across the road for a drink with the lovely local people running the wee bars. The room was comfortable, would have loved an open shower, not a shower over the bath, but water pressure was great!.We loved being able to sit outside, and the only thing missing was a coffee table there to put things on, that would be a great asset. What was incredible was the atmosphere of the restaurant area - the staff were all very attentive, looked you in the eye, were genuinely friendly and caring, and you could feel the energy of the team spirit! We come from hospitality, and felt that this Team must have morning meetings to keep this vibe going and the standard of their work. We happened to meet the Restaurant Manager and praised the staff, and sure enough he told us that the staff have a team meeting every morning, and also in the Afternoons ! We loved the Breakfast buffet with so much on offer, and had the all you can eat BBQ buffet, and the seafood, meats were all super fresh and beef was tender! . We noticed that this restaurant is well frequented from hotel guests and also passers by. All the staff around the hotel were friendly and said hello, from the garden staff to the grounds people, it was epic to feel that energy ! We had a session at the day spa, was good quality, did find that it seemed they were not taking many bookings a day, so it was hard to get in, and would have been great if we could have had more on site Day Spa sessions, as it's handy not to have to leave the hotel,  not sure if they need more staff, or still getting going after C?  Well done Management, it is obvious that you put a lot of energy and time into your Staff and Team Spirit, it can certainly be felt by your guests! We look forward to returning.
Recommend a ground floor room unless you are fine with walking up stairs.

We had the most wonderful experience there with service, cleanliness, comfort of of the beds, kindness/helpfulness from staff, buffet breakfast, the location, the pool and honestly the list could go on!
February this year I went on a solo trip to Bali, to return back here.
I was so very fortunate enough to receive a free room upgrade from being a returning guest, which was an absolute delight and was a highlight to my trip. Once again the staff were so incredibly lovely, the renovations looked fantastic (as they were still under construction last year), my room was heaven and overall my stay there was only one of the best I‚Äôve ever had.
Being fortunate enough to return to Bali in August later this year, I have now booked my 3rd stay with the hotel and wouldn‚Äôt look at booking anywhere else.

3. I requested twin bed, and the receptionist when I checked in said it's twin bed already, but when I come inside the room, it was not set as a twin bed! This is uncomfortable. Luckily, the man who is the coordinator of housekeeping was fast response and be patient to handle my complain.
4. They don't have elevator, but the staff will help you to carry your suitcases if you stay on 2nd or 3rd floor.

My recent stay at the Dash Hotel was disappointing when it came to cleanliness. There were yellow stains on the towels, the back of the toilet seat was also yellow, and we noticed blood stains on the mattress under the sheets. Additionally, the shelves were quite dusty, making me question the overall cleanliness of the room.

Room condition rating: 1/5
The condition of the room was also disappointing. The hotel requires some major renovation, as the walls were cracked and the door handles were corroded. We had to change our first room as the main door wasn't closing properly, which made me feel uncomfortable and gave me the impression that the hotel was not well-maintained.

Service rating: 4/5
The staff at the Dash Hotel were friendly and accommodating. However, after checking out, I was disappointed to find out that the hotel was trying to charge us $100 for small coffee stains we left behind. They said that ""coffee can't be washed off,"" which I found unreasonable.

Accessibility rating: 5/5
One of the positive aspects of the Dash Hotel was its accessibility. The location was great, with easy access to everything we needed during our stay.

Breakfast rating: 3/5
The breakfast at the Dash Hotel was average, however, the coffee was particularly terrible.

Overall, my recent experience at the Dash Hotel was not what I had hoped for, especially when it came to cleanliness and room condition.

We had much better experience when eating in the rest of Bali. One of the reasons I would reconsider if staying again is the cuisine.
Advice to management; your hotel is very good, fix the food. Even traditional dishes felt messed up in comparison to other restaurants in Bali.

Finally, we have been quite dissatisfied with the hotel transfer to Gili islands. Although we know we were paying more in comparison to port prices, the transfer was quite unprofessional.
The taxi service seated additional people in the same car during our transfer, without available seats, which left us seated squeezed and unsafe. Much better go with your own arrangements and not let the resort do it for you!",3866
521,ChIJZdwJTBkZ0i0R_qrOSlJ4P4w,GK Bali Resort Ubud Bali,Bailey Lee,3,"Good and bad

Good-
1. The neighborhood village is lovely and has one of the greatest scenery I stayed in Bali.
2. The breakfast is good, had an excellent french toast there, but you can only choose one set menu without paying for extra.
3. Lot of activities to join, like morning walk, yoga, Bali dance‚Ä¶
4. They offer breakfast box for our early check out.

Bad-
1. We stayed in the first floor, and as soon as walking in the room, we could smell a strong musty smell, we borrowed spray trying to cover the smell and didn‚Äôt work though.
2. It just has too many bugs! Anyone who is terrified of insects shouldn‚Äôt be staying in this resort. In total of two days, me and my friend met ants, flies, dragonflies in the room‚Ä¶
3. One of our sink was leaking on the second day that we stayed, the hotel staff came and fixed it, but it should happen in the first place.",770
522,ChIJZdwJTBkZ0i0R_qrOSlJ4P4w,GK Bali Resort Ubud Bali,Maitreya Shukla,5,"GK BALI RESORT is located in village Sebatu in Ubud. The resort is relatively new in the hotel industry and they r expanding their premises.
Currently it has 5 private villas and about 20 rooms if I'm correct, a dining area and a pool on their property which overlooks rice fields and a forest.
The rooms are relatively good with decent amenities. Although, we did experience a tiny hitch with the balcony doors which were fixed quickly by the staff, the room was good. The bed is comfortable and you may not require the air conditioner after evening because it gets really cold.
The place is isolated and very very quiet. Good place for couples and families.
The restaurant is good. Breakfast is usually included with your booking. You can think of having dinner here. Its reasonably priced and fairly good on the palate. I recommend you to have the local cuisine that they have to offer.
The pool overlooks the forest n rice fields and is a decent sized pool. the location is serene.
The hotel offers transportation to the airport at 5,00,000 IDR and also offers you scooters on rent for every day travel at 1,50,000 IDR a day. They have a detailed itinerary of things they offer and a list of all essentials in Ubud placed in your room so you may want to read that.
The staff is so very friendly and courteous. A special mention for Linda from the GK staff who was so kind and compassionate. She arranged for a breakfast box for us on the day we left the hotel since we had to leave early at 7.15 am and the breakfast area opens at 7.30 am. She had also offered us a local dessert for tasting during one of our dinners at the hotel. Ade at the reception were also very courteous and the entire staff, honestly, was very kind and welcoming in general.
They do offer spa services but it will be in your room. Currently they do not have a spa room, however they are expanding the premises and are in the process of arranging an area for spa, yoga and Balinese cooking classes. So hopefully it will be there in the near future.
Since it is almost a part of the forest you will have mosquitoes and very rarely a tiny odd lizard in the evening in your balcony or on the wall in your room. The staff will provide you with the requisites to keep them away but it's recommended to shut the balcony door at twilight.
All in all you will certainly be well taken care of at this place. Highly recommended at Ubud.",2978

This does a great job blocking out any additional sound coming in from the outside. This resort is also close to the beach, and other hotels with restaurants.

The on site restaurant has great classic Balinese food and will also have traditional Balinese dancing on some nights.

We did not partake in the large outdoor public pool, bar, or fitness area, but these are additional services available to you during you stay.

The kids pool had broken tiles and was extremely slippery which is a major hazard. The location was far from everything. If you are going to Bali to shop definitely do not recommend staying in this resort. Even if you were wanting to go for a walk to get food or a massage. The bathroom smelt like men‚Äôs urine that hadn‚Äôt been mopped properly, even after asking to give a good mop/ clean it still smelt, seemed like they just sprayed air freshener rather than actually fixing the problem.

548,ChIJ-WwHzqFG0i0Rclv6u_ZP9FI,Bali Dynasty Resort,Ryan Butterly,3,"The staff here are great, friendly and accommodating and the hotel isn't too bad.
They moved us rooms due to construction works adjacent to the hotel. Unfortunately, the room they moved us to was at the entrance to the second floor (south wing). The room was fine, but the foot traffic and the sporadic drunken clown walking past in the wee hours meant sleep wasn't great for the five nights we were there. Add to that the two fire alarms that went off in the early hours with no report from the staff if it was real or false.

The clientele staying there can be....... rough!!! (This includes the seedy old bloke giving his equally as old wife a bit of a touch-up in the pool whilst kids were swimming around them). As one previous reviewer said, it's like being at a caravan park in Australia during peak periods, with some very 'diverse' folk....... If you're into it, this is a great place to sit and watch the stereotypical 'Aussie Bali Bogan' strut around the pool showing off their newly acquired body art. We were lucky enough on more than one occasion to see them wrapped in plastic just like the local butcher would wrap your lamb roast.
In saying the above, it isn't the hotels fault for the clientele they have stay with them. Although I would assume it's a core base of their business.

There are other places to stay in Bali for around the same price that wouldn't have as many 'diverse' people staying with them.

Again the staff are excellent the hotel well run and more than accommodating. If it sounds like your kind of place, you won't go wrong. If not, consider other options.",4244

Conveniently located very near the airport (you can actually walk to the airport but I would recommend taking a car). However not too close to food and shopping areas (well it's about 1.8km or slightly over a mile walk to shopping and food areas) but not as pedestrian friendly to walk, you can go via the beach to get to the areas that have shopping and food but it's slightly longer.

Mini fridge in rooms is a plus, but surprisingly no standard kettle and tea, coffee...
And not every room has a hair-dryer.

Pool area is good, the water is a little too hot on a hot day it is not really refreshing.
For the amount of rooms/customers it does not have enough space to stay, unless there very early to get a deck chair.
Parking is big and free.

The first two rooms are good, full facilities with TV, refrigerator, water heater, clean room and bathroom, hot shower.
The second two, we experienced bad services. One of both bathroom was too moist and uncomfortable, but all toilet exhaust had no active fan. The water heater was dirty, cannot be cleaned, so we borrowed the other room. We also asked broom for our room, they said they will bring it to our room later. The most disappointing is that they did not bring any broom until we checked out and no apology. Only later after we checked out, then talked about why our  request was unfinished. They said they were too busy. How disappointing service.
But we still have the trust for third two, these rooms more like the first two, but the sink broken. Water drain was stuck, then later the faucet dropped no water.

So these rooms are mixed, better try to check the room first. Even staff are nice, the service is not really good.

Other than room facility, there are pools, water refill, and meeting room.

Pools have one shallow and another one with varies depth. I'd say this not good for swimming for its small but for enjoy playing water or just view nearby the pool. These pools near the meeting room.

Water refill facility can be found in meeting room. The only one work is cold water. The hot water option is broken, but we should've heater in our room.

Meeting room is just a place near pools, full of tables and chairs. I saw a group of people using the place from around 8 am to 1 pm, there is lunch for them. Try ask staff for this facility.",4369

Hotel is built in a spread out way so it took me sometime to get used to the long corridors (could be an issue for those preferring not to walk - if so please ask for rooms closer to elevators). Food is fine. Room is big with reasonable working and relaxing space. I had a crawling millipede in the bathroom floor, so that is a scary experience for me.

Swimming pool is in centre of the building and rooms surround it. It is okay. No ocean view here but beach is walking distance truly.

Outside there are lots of shops to buy grocery to all supplies and food or eateries.

Wood architecture is really outstanding and has been there for quite a long time it seems. Even chandelier in the reception area - just awesome to witness or other wooden sculptures.

Staff is friendly and helpful.

Internet - almost non existent - it is so weak. It worked okay only in conference hall. Very big problem for us as our work needed good internet.",884

The day was filled with meeting in their conference rooms. Their break snacks and drinks were very nice. The long halls take some getting used to, but the hotel takes measures to keep you safe if the tiles are wet. We enjoyed the swimming pool. It has multiple depths and is good for all ages. Their catered lunch and supper were always tasty. The Prime Plaza is not far from Sanur beach if you prefer sand and salt water. There are small shops and marts all the way to the seaside.

The room had cockroaches crawling up the walls that quickly scattered into hidey holes, the bed sheets were stained, and there were used tissues and cue tips on the floor‚Ä¶

The whole hotel was noisy, with people running between rooms yelling and laughing - wouldn‚Äôt mind if I hadn‚Äôt arrived at 10pm and wanted to relax‚Ä¶ nothing seemed clean, all surfaces felt and looked dirty. The room was neglected it appeared.

Upon raising all the issues with staff there was no help, they apparently booked themselves to capacity and had no rooms available besides this seemingly abandoned one. However upon walking through the hotel, while guests ran around like lunatics in a playground we spied that all rooms seemed to have the same run down dishevelled quality.

The hotel must have been left abandoned during covid and they‚Äôve not done anything to clean it since. Absolutely hands down the most disgusting excuse for a hotel I‚Äôve come across - facility and hospitality wise, do yourself a favour and avoid at all costs, you will have to fight tooth and nail to get a refund - this isn‚Äôt a hotel, it‚Äôs just a means to scam unwitting travellers.",2431

Pros:
- Amazing location in Seminyak, lots of boutique cafes and restaurants around
- 3 pools and having a pool just outside the balcony was amazing
- Lovely service, everyone says hello and is helpful. I spoke to Mary during breakfast and she was very kind.
- They were able to arrange an airport transfer for me late the night before, and even packed a breakfast box for me to eat on the go!!
- Room is big and very comfortable bed
- Breakfast is pretty good, you can order dishes from a menu from the kitchen! Also can order cappuccinos for an extra charge. The croissants are a bit stale though.
- I LOVE the cats that roamed around the resort! They were very cute and friendly, and obviously treated well by the staff - a great sign.

Cons
- No toiletries like mini shampoo, conditioner and soap in the room, just a joint soap/shampoo in the shower. This would really improve the comfort level of a 4 star hotel, along with fluffy slippers and a robe.
- House keeping comes very early, around 9.30am. Make sure to put sign on door of you intend to sleep in a bit and they will come back later.
- Bathrooms are a bit outdated and don't smell super fresh. Would be good if they were updated.
- I didn't get a welcome drink, however I did arrive late around 8pm.
- Fresh hand towels weren't provided each day.
- You need to pay for room or pool side service in case each time, you can't bill to your room tab.
- Spa experience - I had a 90minute massage and asked for a relaxing massage, was anything but. There was no foot wash, selection of oil, the bright overhead lights stayed on the whole time, the masseuse rubbed the same spots up my spine for half the time, was painful, not relaxing at all. Didn't enjoy it so I left after 1 hour. It was nice how each person had a separate room however.

Upon arrival, glasses of water were given to us which was contaminated.

There were heavy storms and was a leak throughout the night in our room. I did contact the staff to notify them and was prompted to fix it.

A lizard entered our villa (where there are a lot of lizards around) but should not be entering in sleeping area considering the doors were closed.

The bathroom - considering Bali is a tropical country and quite hot, the bathroom was a closed-up outdoor area and exposed to the elements such as rain and heat. As soon as you dried up from the showers you feel like you're sweating and hot again. Also, the bath and shower were both stained with mold and dirt which could not be cleaned.

Breakfast was included but did not have much variety and was small portions. Unfortunately also, not tasty either. We did eat outside of the hotel.

When having our room cleaned, towels were not changed and left the old used ones and the pool was still not cleaned. During the 5 nights of staying at the hotel. The pool was only used once for 5 minutes.

On the day we were leaving, we asked for a later checkout and were moved to a bungalow. Even the bungalow was dirty, old, and rundown. The bath and shower were both stained with mold and dirt which could not be cleaned.

I have stayed two weeks in Grand Zuri end of March and would definitely come back!

Pros:
1. Above and beyond service: every single one of the staff been well trained and delivered high level of service standard. For someone who has been in the service industry for almost 20 years, I am honestly impressed. Staff are attentive, always with smile and willing to help with anything
2. Cleanliness: the hotel looks like just being built yesterday. Everything is extremely clean and organised
3. Facility: you get 5 stars hotel facilities even though you pay with lower price range, eg pool, gym, in room safety box, massage (note: iron is on request)
4. Room service: food and laundry are extremely affordable and convenient
5. Soundproof: As a super light sleeper, I was able to sleep without any problem with ear plug
6. Room: I was in executive deluxe room with huge balcony facing the pool. Spacious toilet with good shower

There's no cons for this hotel but here're a few things to share for other travellers:
1. the hotel is 15-20 mins walk to the beach. I love walking so every morning walk to the beach to my surf school (27 Surf) on the nearest beach was a breeze
2. the food in the restaurant takes some time to serve, may be they lack kitchen hand during this recovery from COVID
3. they only serve beer in the restaurant/ pool but bars on the beach are just a short walk away

Thanks Grand Zuri for such a lovely stay and great service. Hope to see you all again soon!",4855

Certainly the staff does work on it to keep up the quality.

Breakfast area is a Desaster with too many guests queue up for it and ‚Äúfighting‚Äù for their food at the buffet.
I rather recommend using the breakfast at the royal restaurant with waiters serving your wishes.

Check-in lobby and Center stage bar is a bit outdated and would require a refresh.

Indeed, toothbrushes are not available, so buy it, hahaha, do you want this one for free too? Free drinking water to take yourself. The car park is spacious and the road is quite good, but a bit narrow. In terms of finding food around the hotel location, it is a bit difficult because you have to walk out and for now Kuta Legian street is quiet and no one sells food or souvenirs. It's worth trying to buy food through an online app for now. The conclusion is, this hotel is quite good if you are just looking for a place to rest, because it is quiet and clean.

There was NO toilet paper in the room. Bring your own toilet paper. Bedding was a bit stained and pillows not great. AC worked well. Rooms were quiet until about 6am when kids were up and loud. But for the price it is what we expected. I did expect toilet paper. Check-out took a long time as there was a line and then they had to go check the room before they would let us leave. Maybe they think we stole all the toilet paper.,3146

Restaurant is super-duper slow so, don't eat there if you are in a hurry. The nasi goreng isn't too bad. Very good value for money for a layover.

The workers in the hotel are really kind and nice, the woman In the reception even asked for a grab (like an uber) for us, and the breakfast was nice, so we are really happy about it.

The thing to improve is the room, the size is okey, but the problem is that there were some humidity and there wasn't a curtain in the bathtub, so if you have a shower, the floor become wet (probably the cause of the humidity), this is the only thing to improve, everything else was nice",1825

We searched and found this hotel online and did a walk-in. We booked and pre-paid $362,000 IDR cash for this type of/superior room (including a one-way transfer to the airport) as we had an 8 hour wait before our flight.
I double checked with the young male receptionist to ensure we could check-in early at 10am the next day with this type of room, and he said it was ok.
We get there at 10am to check-in, speak with the same receptionist and check-in is now at 2pm and they're full! Nothing is available until a room is cleaned at 12pm at the earliest.
Please do not accept a booking if you know you cannot accommodate your guests.

They provide two bottles of water but no bottle opener so the entire table edge is peeling due to everyone using that as a bottle opener. Looks good in the photos but that‚Äôs about it.

Limescale build up and old thin walls, doors and windows.

However, we explained our disappointment in the old style rooms and they gave us complementary upgrades to the XL rooms which are their newest edition with modern features, newer finishes/details. Very good showers, far superior and clean.

The rooms are spacious, clean, and cozy with complete amenities and a beautiful outdoor bathtub (we were staying at The Big Garden Room). We are very mesmerized by the interior details.

Great and friendly staff, always attentive to our needs and informative. We also loved seeing staff greet customers with a smile and warmth.

Overall, excellent experience, definitely looking forward to returning.",5085
631,ChIJcw7ZD6FH0i0Rm4ujZxj8rgo,Lloyd's Inn Bali,George Seah,2,"Pros: Good location. Relatively new renovation and decoration. Friendly staff all around, from front desk to security. Room is generally clean and housekeeping does a great job.

Cons: Impossible to take an afternoon nap after our sunrise tour as it was too noisy both outside the hotel and along the corridor.
Impossible to wake up late as during 9+, when the housekeeping staff starts to prepare their trolleys, there will be some noise that you can hear very clearly inside the room. Footsteps, conversations, tearing open of plastic covers, wheeling of the trolley, makes the room really noisy.
Room feels small even we upgraded and paid for Super Deluxe. Our 29‚Äù luggage fits the luggage storage nicely, anything bigger will go on the floor.

The 2 stars is purely for the hotel staff friendliness and hospitality. Will not ever stay in Bali again unless they upgrade their doors to fire rated type.",1893

I stayed in the main hotel, ocean front suite which was stunning but it can be noisy unfortunately. We had 2 quiet nights and then the party with the DJ on the 3rd night almost had us checking out. I recorded the noise in the room because I couldn‚Äôt believe it was so loud. It was like I was in the nightclub - when you‚Äôre paying that much money each night it wasn‚Äôt acceptable for us. I was lucky that the manager went above and beyond to find us another room. He was apologetic and understanding. We stayed in a stunning villa for the rest of the holiday and it was faultless. The only drawback is you don‚Äôt get the views of the ocean in the villa. I can‚Äôt fault the facilities, the staff, the spa, the quality of the hotel.  The main pool can get a bit rowdy, we think the rowdy people were not hotel guests but people who had paid to use the hotel facilities. We ended up not using the main pool but stayed in our villa. If I could be guaranteed of no parties with a DJ for the duration of my holiday I would return and definitely stay in a room with a view.",2607

The breakfast was really good with both a la carte and buffet. The location is fantastic if you like experiencing the night life, bars, clubs and restaurants. They use a buggy to take you to the roadside at no cost so you can walk the streets. We had a sea facing room and we could hear the crashing of waves which was fantastic. You cannot swim at the beach as there is a lot of debris that gets washed up due to the crazy current and waves. The room was great, room service was really good. We visited the in hotel bar the Woo Bar a few times, it was pretty cool and relaxing. It had day beds at the back which was really nice. The music at the Woo Bar was not to our taste, the Potato Head was next door and the music there was just fantastic. We also used the bar by the main reception, this area is open from both sides so you get the cool ocean breeze, there is ample space and coaches to relax.

Free afternoon tea is available by the smaller pool each day, which was a nice touch.
Great idea is the issuing of Room numbered Pool Towel cards. If those towels that are left on sunbeds aren't used within a period of time, they are taken away so that it's a fairer system for everyone to get a sunbed when they want one! Wish a lot of places had this system!!

Location: Quite convenient, barely 10-15 mins away from airport, also beside Grand Lucky Supermarket so could easily get some loads if you need something!

Amenities: So far ok, water heater works just fine, exhaust not working in our room. A/C was leaking on the 1st day but they had it repaired and it was ok in our entire stay. No water bottle but they have water dispenser near the dining area. They also replace towels daily and supposedly clean rooms daily, but NOT thoroughly btw, like I could still see cupcake crumbs we ate from the other day.

Anyway they have free buffet breakfast daily, mostly local food, with coffee which is just ok... American Breakfast is free if you dont get the buffet, but if you want both you just pay R50k for addl. American Breakfast.

Staff: Were nice, they suggested some plces to visit since we have some free time.

Price: Rate is quite affordable so dont expect too much I think. We got this via Travelooka... Not so bad for us who spends most time outside for tours !

The mall is only a 2 minute walk away, although it doesn‚Äôt have much for stores anymore most are closed down and has become more of an indoor market. We seen Ant-Man in 3D, and loved that this hotel had the word Stark in it, as we are Marvel fans. There was a bar outside attached to the hotel but from our room, we couldn‚Äôt hear it. So my advice is to ask for one of the newer rooms that is not close to the bar, and the bad reviews won‚Äôt apply. üòä Thank you for a great stay. Would definitely stay here again and was one of the best rooms we had in Bali.",445

Locks on doors are broken.
Hair all over floor and bed upon check in.

Struggled to sleep all night due to feeling unclean.

The hotel is not a 4 star hotel and is completely overpriced for the area. Would recommend anywhere but here!

Edit: in response to the hotels reply I think it‚Äôs safe to say that if protocols and procedures in place were followed and the room lived up these standards there is a serious problem. As shown in the photos attached to the review black mould can be seen growing on surfaces in bathroom, general grime everywhere and stains all over sheets.
In addition, safety concerns were also highlighted to the hotel without any care or concern from staff.
Following complaints the hotel has provided no adequate recourse and I would strongly advise anyone who wishes to stay here does so with caution.

720,ChIJtUeFasAj0i0R3sba-35izDg,The Kenran Resort Ubud By Soscomma,Bailey Smith,5,"I can‚Äôt recommend this place enough! EXCELLENT, secluded location if you can bear the 1h drive from the airport.
The rooms are luxury and incredibly high end. They‚Äôre large with very comfortable beds. There is an amazing rain shower and tub with a view if you want it!
The breakfast menu was fabulous with very decent prices. Dinner as well!
The pools were amazing too! We didn‚Äôt get to try the lower one, but the top one was fantastic and sunny in the morning and early afternoon.
The only downside is because it is smack in the middle of the jungle, there were quite a few bugs and drain flies in our room. I believe mostly harmless, but I know how some feel about bugs!
I was traveling with a friend, so we didn‚Äôt exactly look for the romance, but I do feel like this has a very romantic, honeymoon-like atmosphere.
Overall, I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone looking for a place to stay in Ubud.",771

The staff is very friendly, courteous, and helpful and responds quickly when needed. They also cook great food at the agreed time. The furnishing and decor is great, and the bathrooms are unique. The views are great, too.",3902
723,ChIJtUeFasAj0i0R3sba-35izDg,The Kenran Resort Ubud By Soscomma,Andrew Aitken,3,"Our experience here was mixed.
The setting of this resort is really nice. Amongst rice fields and the view out your window is of the jungle with the noise of a stream running below. The rooms are quite large and the pool facilities are great.
Unfortunately the road into the hotel is in a really bad state and is bumpy as hell. You aren't able to walk to anywhere for food or anything like that, so will always need to catch a taxi to go out (understandable considering the location but something still to consider). The restaurants in the hotel are quite overpriced considering the quality unfortunately. The food was often bland, and both the food and drinks were quite expensive considering other prices in Bali. The staff were quite lovely, but definitely inexperienced. The WiFi was terrible and crashed almost every 15 minutes. Hot water took a seriously long time to begin flowing in the shower or bath, and it was barely hot once it warmed up.
From what I understand, the resort is relatively new and given time, I think they could improve on a lot of the issues raised and make this a really nice resort to stay in.
At the moment though, I probably wouldn't recommend Kenran resort to friends unfortunately.",411

Room wall was quite thin, can hear the other guest talking/snoring/getting inside their room. Restroom is clean, I only saw a soap dispenser but no shampoo? The staff offered me their amenities but I didn't take it. Unfortunately their lift was broken the time I visited, too bad for a new hotel. Check in process was easy, but for check out they needed to check the room first before giving back ur deposit (50k idr). Overall, quite good, I got my double room at 165k thru Agoda.",3158
738,ChIJVVVVFcDnaC4RBH9H8lDF6NA,Nindya Biodistrict Hotel,Mica Glass,2,"Room is ok, I chose double cabin while I stayed alone so I can get spacious cabin. All staffs are polite and awesome, they told me it's kinda new capsule hotel, no wonder everythings work perfectly. The staffs and facilities are the only reason I gave 2 stars.

Several low points tho :

1. SUPER NOISY, whatever your neighbours do will be heard clearly. My left and right cabin mate argued for something and I can heard it super loud. At night some kids thought it was a good idea to run here and there in the dorm while knocking some doors and it was super annoying. Also, the sound of door unlock and lock, sound of footsteps, banging the door are also super loud. I woke up 6 times in the night because of those annoying things. Some moms also shout something to call their husband or kids, and it's also super loud. C'mon it's capsule hotel and shared cabin area, not your private sweet home or hotel room, at least be mindful with your sound volume. But since it's in Indonesia, what do you expect, education, manner and privacy were not taught well here üòÖ

2. Aircon is so so exp. The main control is located near the cabin entrance, there are several touch screen control for all the cabins, like for cabin 1-5 there is 1 control board. I set the aircon to 20 degree and turbo fan, but someone decides to turn it off üòÖ. Even when set to 16 fan turbo, it was not so cold, you can even say it's warm cabin.

If you need a quality rest, stay away from this hotel, unless you can make sure you are the only one staying here. Or maybe choose the single cabin, I think it will be quieter since there are no spoiled brats or dumb moms who can't even handle their kids well.
With proper sound proofing, this hotel can be much much better.

Can't imagine how noisy it will be at peak season like the ied holiday, where family usually gathers.

A big no for me.",3178

There is a large parking area that is adjusted to the floor of your room so you no longer need to use a list to reach your room floor. It's just that the road that connects the floors is very narrow for 2 cars, not to mention it's quite uphill so the car is a bit ""forced"" after passing each other. For room facilities, there is no kettle, hairdryer or other facilities, only a flat screen TV and telephone. Hot and cold water is available in the bathroom, but only cold water in the sink. When we had problems with the TV it took almost 1 hour to get to the hotel technician, which is a shame. There is a swimming pool on the rooftop, but to swim you have to consume a minimum of food/drinks worth IDR 30,000 / person, while to just relax you have to consume a minimum of IDR 10,000. Well, I think it should be free of charge. At night, around the hotel there are many street vendors, it's just that most of them are non-halal, so Muslims must be careful in choosing where to eat.",725

The swimming pool located at the top level. Supposed to be open at 7am, but during my visit it was closed (the receptionist said the guard isn't yet coming... to bad =( )

During the pandemic, the restaurant is not open. Breakfast was delivered to your room. During my visit, the menu was provided by 3th party catering.

Being in the middle of Bandung City, many street food cart just along the road, and many more in the next corner (less than 10 minutes walks). The street food was a bit pricey than it usual price in other places. Be caution for Muslim, as some of the street food along the hotel road is Haram (pork, frog/swike).

The parking building next to the hotel is spacious (5 levels parking building). Drop your belonging at the lobby, than head to the parking building.

There is a police station next to the hotel for your comfort. There is also some mini restaurant just next to the hotel should you feel hungry. An Indomart at the South of the hotel should you need for some snack or cold beverages.",393

When we checked in, we got the connecting rooms as promised. Also, the security personnel were kind enough to allow us to park in front of the hotel (where possible), to allow my father-in-law disembark using his wheelchair.

The rooms were clean, although it could be a little bit noisy in the evening. The breakfast, as expected, was heavenly. The croissant was the best. I enjoyed the plain scrambled egg too, as not many Indonesian hotels serve this. Parking was plenty as the space is shared with an adjacent apartment, but it can be quite far from the hotel. Alfamart is nearby, and they do delivery.

There is a swimming pool, a mini indoor playground, and a lounge on F2, so my young children could still play without going out of the hotel. Thank you Harris!",2523

Since I was staying during Ramadan, the hotel offered suhoor in place of buffet breakfast. The menu was quite decent and more than enough for one to prepare for the day's fast.

Place : in RE Martadinata street, right in the middle of the city. You can just walk to any major city landscape from here.

Ambient : super cozy, very nice

Room : clean and big enough for a couple or even a family with 1 or 2 small kids

Amenities : it‚Äôs a standard amenities like toothbrush, soap, shampoo, and lotion. But if you need anything else, just ask.

Swimming Pool : place in a 3rd floor and for hotel guest only since you will need your room access card to go there. From swimming pool you can go to a gym.

Breakfast : simple, not many variety but it taste good.

Hospitality : very good

Price : quite fair price, but during a major even, the price will change significantly.

There are many hotel in Bandung, but this hotel feels different. Why? Just try it and you will know.",119

No information on breakfast or wifi were given. There were vouchers inside card holder with incorrect validity dates but vouchers were not required for breakfast checkin. You only had to provide your room number. For wifi, select the visiting option and enter pw on paper, not in house guest with room number and name.

Elevator area had a weird smell. It reminded me of toilet spray or some sort of baby wipes. Wasn't pleasant at all. Room itself had a weird layout. I did like that the toilet and shower were separated with their own doors but weird that it wasn't connected with the divider instead. Shower's water pressure was low and had spotty hot water. Most of the time, the water was warm and sometime it'll turn hot for a few seconds before turning warm again. It was weird because during the day, the water seemed warmer than night. Bedsheets had brown stains on them, one patch looked like large smear or chocolate or even waste. It was disgusting! Towels didn't smell too clean. Shower's floor towel was wet and dirty after housekeeping too. Made me wonder if it was actually changed. The only thing I did liked about the room was the absence of carpet.

There's two water bottles provided for free next to the sink. However, there were also two large water bottles to be charged if consumed next to the TV.

Breakfast. They did offered a lot of options but even with the warm, buffet setting, food were not hot. Weren't as tasty either. Also, they didn't offer orange juice, which was weird.

Also, be careful when leaving the hotel. There is an extra step down. Don't be like me and trip every time. Stay was ok but I wouldn't consider it a four star hotel.",2156

The staff are attentive and responsive. The hotel is antique, although they renovated the lobby interior into something like art decor (okay, it could be better). The room and corridor seem original and classic. I love the vibes, but several parts can be improved.

Even the floors are covered in rugs; I found some tiles are broken, and some of our walls are dirty/stained.

I stayed in a Double bed suite with a room facing Asia Africa street on the second floor, including balcony access. However, the room was not soundproof.

(-) points

1. The hotel looks aesthetically pleasing but it reeks with sewer smell, especially their lift.

2. We book classic room and it‚Äôs extremely small when they fit an extra king bed inside. We kept on knocking on the walls and the bed it‚Äôs just frustrating. There‚Äôs no closet and storage area too.

3. There‚Äôs an incident where we actually knew that the hotel staff went into our room without our presence but we didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss about it, we brought all of our precious belongings because we don‚Äôt feel good leaving them.

It‚Äôs located infront of Alun2 station, so the ‚Äòmacet‚Äô is really bad. Overall, I don‚Äôt recommend this place unless they improve that sewer smell. ü•≤",1711

2. The hotel mattress is very soft and makes your waist really sore. I personally don't really like the mattress. but this is personal taste.
3. Please pay attention to the quality of the towels again. it looks a bit dirty until I ask for a replacement. try to have a service life and replace a new one within a certain period of time.

The hotel building was quite old; you can easily tell from the layout of the building. Despite that, every corner of the room was clean and adequately maintained. Water pressure should be improved, however. Water heating was also not consistent. Sometimes you have to wait for a while for the water to get warm, while sometimes it got very hot.

+ AC is cold.

- There were 2 instances where I almost can't flush the toilet. I need to shake the buttons so it refills the water.

-Mats were dirty, so i asked for a new one. Took a long time to deliver the mats. Seems they don't have standard for mats.

- The main door doesn't close properly, so need to always check and lock it.

- The balcony door lack sound proofing, I can't sleep easily because the sounds of motorcycle.

The Breakfast:

+ Pretty good standard and quite delicious. I enjoyed it, could've been better, but overall I think they are doing their best and I appreciate it.

The Parking:

+ The front parking is really small, and the back parking is in an awkward position from the entrance.

The Service:

+ I think they are friendly enough to the guests. Always keep on their smile whenever possible.

Should bed sheet and pillow case are significant to your comfort, then I'd strongly recommend you to find other budget hotel.

Stayed here for a day with family (4), booked only one room with additional extra bed. They have six floor which the 6th is their restaurant and cafe (Level Six). So here‚Äôs the detailed review:

Pros + :
- The location is easy to find
- All staffs are nice, reachable whenener you need
- The room and the hotel itself are clean
- Lots of aesthetic spot for photo
- Breakfast is delicious and affordable (only 50k for 2 pax)
- No need to worry about parking lot even though the hotel has limited space, the security will help you
- Using king size bed which spacious enough for 3 people

Cons - :
Nothing bad, just personal tips:
- The location is close to anywhere but some of popular places is pretty far for walking distance (such as lengkong kecil) still recommends to use ojol/car hailing
- You might find a hotel room somewhere that can get more than 2 people (when it should be 2 people max) without extra charge, but in here it‚Äôs a mandatory to add extra bed if you plan to stay with more than 2 people in one room, also there‚Äôs a deposit too so don‚Äôt forget to prepare cash",3373

The only problem that's been bothering me is the restaurant (breakfast) and the so called premiere lounge on the 18th floor. The servers on the lounge floor, specially the one called mba Purnama is a tad disappointing, I really don't feel welcome during my time in the lounge, they didn't even offer me any drinks, they dont even greet the guests properly.  Dont get me wrong, they are not lazy, but the hospitality part which I hope to get from a 5 star hotel service is really far from expectation. Even my kids are more friendlier than them. AND THE  WORST PART, during the dinner in the lounge, it is very very crowded, it doesnt look like a lounge, more like a wedding reception where all the guests are lining upfor food and plates that are constantly need to be refilled. Finally, due to the unavailability of seats, we chose to eat at the 18 restaurant and spent around 1.5mil for the food because the waiter said we can't bring the food from lounge to the restaurant, but right after we ordered, many guests from the lounge are coming and bringing food from the lounge and sit inside the restaurant.

Looking for food? Just order it online. Since you're in the city, there are plenty of food options. It's much cheaper ordering it online. And hey, you're helping the restaurant and the driver at once.

The value for money are great especially if you book directly from their website. I pay around 800k for large room with bathtub + breakfast for 2 people. Location are perfect, so close to many hot spot and delicious food.

But it's VERY NOISY. Way worse than midtown because the hotel cafe & restaurant are exactly infront of your room. You can hear all the noice coming from cafe. Not only that, since the room does not have any sound proof, you can hear the furniture noice from upstairs, also cars and motorcycles noise from the road. So for the light sleeper people, bring earplugs or noise cancelling earphone/headphones if you want to stay here.

The room also smells weird. Please put some reed diffuser or just use air freshener so the room smells good.

Although the menu variations are plenty, but most of them are so-so, I wouldn‚Äôt call them delicious though. I wish the management shall try to compare their foods with other equal hotel for comparisons.

what i really don't like about this hotel is the room itself. the window is facing the corridor, not the outside area. you will see the glass window facing the place where people are passing by, even though they already put some kind of filter to minimize the transparency of the glass. but i feel like staying inside an aquarium. it's kinda creepy, so i usually keep the curtains closed.",899

Everything is within a walking distance! A convenience store is next to the premises and there are many street food vendors in the vicinity. Paskal 23 is also a 5-minute walk from the hotel.

Our room was smaller than expected. Spanning 15 square meters, the room was too small to our liking. However, it was decorated in a contemporary style with a touch of Hollywood Glam, creating such an elegant ambiance. Our windows overlooked Chinatown Bandung, which was great. The bathroom was a bit claustrophobic but we liked the strong, steady water flow from the shower, perfect for massaging our backs.

The breakfast was nice. The menu was kind of ""three-star hotel standard"" but at least it was decent. The swimming pool is located next to the restaurant. We did not try it since the pool area was kind of crowded in the morning.

Don't place your expectations on a high bar, but for a relatively low price of 280k, it is better than expected. Stayed here for 2 nights with friends, we booked 2 rooms. Each had problems. Room A's condition was sanitary and comfortable, and the problems would be that the shower door wouldn't close properly and at night other guests would open their windows (which you are not allowed to) and casually have a loud conversation (so maybe everyone can hear them? Haha). It was also a bit dim in the room, even with the additional led lighting. Room B had a great view facing west, but the additional led lighting didn't work. Which led to the room being even more dim during the night. Also, water dispensers are available in the property, which is highly appreciated. Parking is very limited due to the nature of the land area being very small. They installed a car lift (very first time using one), which became a hassle if we were to return to park our car multiple times. Regardless, the selling point of this hotel was its location. It was tremendous that we were able to walk in the mornings to see Braga Street and walk along Asia Afrika Street. At night, there is a night market just on the street behind the property: which serves as an option for us for culinary activities (hehe). Aside from the location, the staff overall was warm and friendly. The security guard also shared his concerns regarding our car tires when we parked, and we couldn't thank him enough as he successfully avoided our vacation into a disaster. Overall, for short stays and the location, this property is recommended. For longer stays, I recommend the budget hotel located at Festival Citilink Bandung (which I stayed previously and has its own set of perks and drawbacks).",914

Room: i stay here in condotel, spacious and has a sofa. It's quite clean and well-mantained for an old hotel. The bathroom not too big but enough space. I like the facility that is usually there for old hotel : tali jemuran at the bathtub area and good stable hot shower water. Also completed with hair dryer near wastafel area. Since it's condotel, it equipped with a small kitchen area. So you have additional wastafel and spacious area for put your food and eating tools. The room overall has many drawers including in the wardrobe. The price also so worthed and affordable for such type of room. The cons about the amenities, they still used single small bottles for shower gel, shampoo etc. It will b better to have shower gel/fluid soap in a refill bottle so it lessen the plastic wastes. The same with drinking water arrangement. More preferred to have a refill bottles than plastic bottles.

Pool : the pool is a star. It's wide, clean, and has good safety bars especially in the deep area. The positon also good because it placed in special area not near any dining area like many budget hotel does. Well, that's the advantage from old hotel that still has spacious area to build their facilities back then.  There's a big pool with 3 type of depth and 2 smaller shallow pool (around the knee depth of adult height).  The most wanted place in the pool area is the hot tub , it's a small round pool with hot water. In the full hours, for example in the Saturday , it filled with people (old, young and children) to sit and enjoy it. The cons are the pool watcher (the persons that watch safety of the pool area) is not seating in the high chair, although they are stand by closely all the time in the stairs near the pool.  The towel is allowed only within the pool area.

Food: food for breakfast has quite complete variety. The taste quite tasty. But sometimes there's one or two type of dish not really fresh. But it's enjoyable. In the weekend it's full of guests, so maybe better come early or a little bit around 9 am to have a more easy time to eat and seats. But the staff will help you to have seats in packed hours.

Positions of hotel: is strategic with many places to go. Near Braga street and Asia Africa street. Near Cathedral Catholic Church, only need to crossing a train rail.

They have a pool for adult and children. The fastest route from my room to the restaurant was via pool. Be careful, the stairs near the pool was a bit slippery.

I really love the parking lot. It is way too spacious. I can parked my car easily.

Please notes that this hotel don't have an elevator due to the concept is semi resort. If you bring too many items just ask the concierge to bring your items to your room.

After moving to our new room,  our stay quickly turned from dismay and disappointment to fantastic and splendid. We stayed in the hotel that day and played archery, flying fox and billiard.

Cons : We arrived midnight and the parking lot already full, there was some space but absolutely very tight, maybe only 5cm left to the next car, we also found that there is no direct access to the parking lot from the lobby (at the time).. The bed cover a little bit smelly, the room a little bit stuffy and dusty since i sneez everytime.. the windows can be opened but only 10 cm..

- Parking lot
- Road sign should be more visible
- I think the room need to be air purified for each book

The amenities was enough, got your usual tootbrush and toothpaste, the soap and shampoo was plentifull, the towel could be better, not quite soft but acceptable. Hot water was enough, no problem on bathroom.
The staffs were friendly and helpful
The food was quite monotonous (the breakfast) after 5 weeks i got bored with the breakfast, there's fruit, cereal, toast, coffee or tea and juices, 2 kind of carbs either noodle or rice or pasta, one kind of protein (chicken or fish), one side dish (tofu, tempeh), one veggies, and traditional dish (rice porridge or green bean porridge)

Very close to a bar, and surrounded by coffeehouse and restaurant, but had to walk for a bit.

You can feel that the hotel is meticulously well-designed with comfort and experience at the forefront. There's a consistent and tasteful peacock theming throughout the building.

Location was superb, being on the centre of Bandung so its easy to access. However the service was a bit of a letdown, especially when i expect the same level of service from Pullman Ciawi.

The check-in was supposed to be at 2PM, but out of my 2 bookings, my one other room was only available at 3.15 pm and its even after ive been calling several times to the receptionist. This happened eventho they already send me a WA text a day prior, asking what time i will be checking-in the next day. The receptionist seemed to just focused on how i will pay all the expenses, rather than explaining the facilities or the breakfast arrangement on the next day.

Oh and their breakfast. Where should i start: when i asked, finally one of the staffs informed me that since our room was on the 15th floor, then our breakfast will be in Mad Cow restaurant. However when we came, it seemed that the staffs were overload (although it wasnt very crowded). The staffs doesnt care with the fact that we need 5 chairs instead of only 4. When i asked them whether or not we can merge 2 tables together, they said we cant since it will block the way (eventually they allowed it since it didnt block anything). Please bear in mind, i was traveling with a toddler and an elderly. It doesnt even make them think to help us in anyway.

Maybe because of the limited space, there were many foods were made to order. It was understandable, however we had to wait for around 20 minutes to received the food (i.e american breakfast, mie ayam)

All in all, quite disappointed on the service. I thought all Pullman has the same level of service (that is why i choose to be a member of accor after i stayed in Pullman Ciawi) but maybe i was wrong.

Cons, dirty room and limited facilities. The floor of my room was dirty, there was multiple stains on the carpet. The swimming pool is nothing worth writing home about.

The room itself (studio type in level 11) has with 2 sides of big glass window overlooking bandung city, excellent! Whoever the architec was - although the room isn't as spacious studio as one would expect - definitely a person  with a distinctive eyes of detail! It's not grandeur, but the functionality to details put into every inch of the room is highly appreciated. Even the bathroom's door is 1 door to cover the bathroom and the shower room (double function - efficient!) Shower's water debit is also very good with hot water running well. West Java Batik in Frame was nicely put the alleys to the rooms in each floor, gives the sense of where we are.

Pool is available at the roof top and unlike many other hotels that has outdoor pool on their roof toop, this pool is a semi-outdoorsy.. with glass windows on one side and roof top in the other side.. only top of of the pool that's open air... somewhat reminds me in one of the hotel I stayed in Singapore. Here is pretty small though..

Their other facilities in 18th floor are gym and sauna that works well. Mini bar with a small area for couch potato'ing also available (just like B&B around the world) and what's best is they served Bintang with ice! üòÅ Upbeat music in 18th floor but not loud at all..  very good! I'm not deaf!

Offering  different experience than staying in a brick and mortar hotel in Bandung, Urban brings the concept of staying inside the container...

Apart of unique experience, the location at one of the prime area in Bandung is the reasons to stay here. Amenities is minimum but quite similar to other 2/3 star accomodation. Some improvement needed such as the curtain (with broken rope... they should use a stronger one)and  toilet (smell not too good... probably due to no air circulation....). The Hotel has minimum staffing but very polite (Sundanese in general are polite, though).

You will have one container with one double or 2 twin size bed, small TV (but who watch this these days), toilet. Outside of container room a sofa and small outdoor round table with 2 chairs is provided for you to enjoy the evening Bandung cool breeze of air.

For the one having a sleep difficulties with the noise, staying here is a big NO... as the container is not a sound proof materials meanwhile some cafe serving beer is open until late midnite. As for me, I am an easily sleeping person so there is no issue with the noise.

No breakfast is taken as the location is great for a morning walk to the old Bandung area behind Yogya Riau Junction (busy supermarket just cross the street from hotel) such as Jalan Trunojoyo, Bahureksa and Sultan Agung with some local cafe to have a proper coffee and breakfast.",5531

‚úÖ There is ample parking if you are driving & security guard to help.

ü´§ The breakfast was not variety and the same almost every day I was there. If you had your breakfast around 8-9am or almost closing time, many food would have finished and they don‚Äôt really replenish it.

üò°The room & hospitality!!!

‚ÄºÔ∏è I booked the room for 5D4N and after the first night, I received a Whatsapp message saying that I have to change my room to a different one because the receptionist gave me a wrong room upon checking in. They wrongly gave me a room upgrade than the one that I have paid. From studio to deluxe. So they want me to change to studio.

üò° I found it as very rude as it was not a mistake that I had done. I already unpacked my things on the first night & went out until late night on the second night. Then, they told me that they wanted to pack my things and transferred it to a different room even though I was not present at that time! Rude and so inappropriate!

üò° I reached hotel around 12am and requested that I would move to a different room in the morning, just let me stay the night in my current room. Asking them to give me time to rest and packing but they told me that if I wanted to stay a night in the room, I have to pay extra because that was not the room that I had paid. I was very furious and frustrated.

‚ÄºÔ∏è First, I didn‚Äôt ask for a room upgrade for free, it was them who gave me a wrong room.

‚ÄºÔ∏è Second, without giving me time to sort things and forcing me to go out from the room that they gave wrongly, it was just so unfair & unpleasant for me.

‚ÄºÔ∏è Third, the studio room was not well cleaned and cared. The bed that I slept on, the mattress cover they used, had holes on it. Only one pillow was given even though in the room picture on Agoda website, showed 2 pillows. Toilet floor also was not as cleaned as in deluxe room. I was just too tired to complain, I just want to enjoy another 2 nights in Bandung & couldn‚Äôt wait to check out from the hotel.

(-) However there's some point need to improve such as. In our room #1902, the toilet smells stinks everytime it's flush, happen since day 1. The wardrobe broken, microwave insides really dirty, ants everywhere and cleaning works need to go detail.
Another thing to concern is the bath towel conditions was awful. Not stars hotel standard at all. (Pic attached).

Our room was fine, though the bathroom is quite cramped, especially the toilet that has leg room for short people only üôÇ. Note that hairdryers are not supplied in each room, which unfortunately meant I missed out as all had been given out when I requested one.

First impression of the hotel was great - it looked modern and clean, and the staff was friendly. We stayed at the apartment building which is separate from the hotel side. We were surprised at how the interior looked like. Firstly, the apartment looks worn with stains on the wall, cracked tiles and torn wallpaper. The worst part of the apartment would be the toilet as the water leaks out of the shower and practically floods the toilet without any proper drainage. We informed the reception about this issue but we were just told that it would be brought up to the maintenance team.

While we were delighted to receive a free dining voucher on NYE, the food options were grossly limited and not up to standards. As the kitchen was rushing to get food out quick, the chicken satay came out raw which ruined the dining experience for me.

This hotel has great potential but sadly it was these small things that really soured the trip. I hope the management can take note of this and rectify these issues.",1087

Checked in the next week to a room with an unpleasant smell also coming from the toilet.

Called reception/room service (fast response time) and they say they will be treating the room. They came to spray air freshener in the room but there were still a strong urine stench frm the toilet. The toilet was definitely not well maintained for both stays.

1) breakfast buffet  - chicken in the pot had the wiring from what I think is the scrubber sponge , fish have hair , dishes were all mostly cold leftovers with no topups even when we arrived at 9am when breakfast ends 10, dishes not heated with fire , all cold . ( only thing I‚Äôm comfortable to eat is cooked on spot eggs and koko crunch ) even breads were burnt , table many ants , staff seems lost and disorganized while sitting us down a table after some time
2) overall cleanliness not up to standard - sheets , pillowcase have small stains , cups were dirty , floors not so clean
3) did not give us bed type we booked which was large bed non smoking room . Front desk lady said they only have non smoking left for large bed . We chose to go with single beds but non smoking as we had no choice . Joined the beds ourselves as it‚Äôs faster than waiting for the staff
4) staff were mostly courteous and smiled but did not provide up to standard service, rather slow  . When We returned 4 + pm on our 2nd day stay . They forgot or have yet to clean room when we put the sign outside our door since 9 am before we left .Had to call them to clean it, waited half an hour for someone to come before we left for dinner . When we returned there were no towels , bath mat and 1 toothbrush short , no room slippers . They probably threw out the previous ones we used and forgot to replenish .had to call them but they were too slow in coming with the towels it was at least a good 20-30 mins wait being sticky from a day out in room before can bathe and rest
5) staff refused to give small bucket of ice saying bar counter close at 10 pm but I requested it was not yet 10 pm Tone and their way of replying was not helpful and nice sounds little impatient
6) old furniture , old vibes , not well maintained
7) only good point is location central and affordable but have to cross very busy roads ,some of which are uneven  to get to nagoya hill mall. May not be so safe and convenient for kids , elderly to walk all the way to explore nearby malls and etc  . Best to book grab/ taxi to get to nagoya hill mall , grand batam mall , escape walking in the heat . I believe there‚Äôs better hotels in batam with decent location at around same price

Then was shown a room in another building which took forever to get there because of slow lifts, but which at least looked like the pics in Agoda, but again stank of cigarette smoke.

However, there are a few factors that I believe can be fixed:
1) The light switches can only be controlled near the doors. So if you want to off the lights, you have to get off the bed and walk all the way in order to switch it off.

2) The temperature of the shower is bad. It's either the water gets too hot, or it's freezing cold.

3) The power outlets are too far apart from one another. Only one in between the 2 beds.

4) Breakfast buffet selection was wide, but the flavours are not that great. Eggs were pretty tasteless, and the cereal were soggy not crispy anymore.

5) Layout of the room was pretty odd. There was a random armchair sitting at the corner of the room.

Room: The room is very cozy and within reach. It is comfortable for a solo traveller like me, however it may get a little tight if a couple were to stay in. For Muslims travellers, praying in the room may be a little tight due to the direction of the Qiblah and the space provided.

Service and Safety: The service of the hotel staff is amazing, everything is done very quickly and swiftly. I am quite surprised to see the safety features of the hotel as well. Hotel access card knows which storey you stay in, the moment you tap you access card in the lift, it will automatically choose the storey you are staying on.

Breakfast: I was expecting a buffet. However, possibly due to low census of guests in the hotel, they served us with an ala carte. I ordered kway teow goreng with omelette and it tasted nice.

Location: The hotel is strategically located by the road, which makes it really convenient to order a grab/gojek. It is also walkable distance to Grand Batam Mall. On the right of the hotel, there is Kamaya Spa and a nice lounge to hang out at (Hulu Hala). It is also nearby a market should you want to grab some goodies to bring back to your country at such great prices.

Customer service gets my thumbs up. For the first 2 days, they checked in with us at breakfast. Our feedback on the smell of cigarette smoke and loud singing was met with sincere regret and apology from the management. Had really good stay in this hotel.This was sorted out immediately.

1722,ChIJS2ZTSUyn2TERR48oDhqLb0o,Kiki Beach Resort Batam,Cheryl Heng,4,"4/5 for the overall experience during my stay at Kiki Beach.

It is as advertised its like a fake Maldives but located in Batam. Really nice Glamping experience! The staff were friendly and they are just one Whatsapp Message away.

1) Toiletries, they do provide the necessity like Shampoo, Soap, Conditioner and 2 rolls of toilet paper. So do note to bring your own toothbrush! You can ask for hair dryer from their reception as well. You can also ask for hot water / plain water from their sea pantry, they do top up 2 bottled mineral water daily and a change of towels

2) Room, very spacious! The bed are very clean as well and comfortable overall the room was very clean. Just please take note not to leave any food inside your room as it might attract rats which we have encounter on one occasion but their staff was quick to response to help us catch it unfortunately they got away too fast hahah. So if you order any food please leave outside for the staff to collect and not in your room!

3) Beach, the beach was rather dirty near the shore so do take note, however their indoor manmade pool is good enough and very clear! Recommend to rent their float and just float away at their pool.

4) Meals, pretty average and good meals! I ordered room service everyday and it was worth it as I was staying at their Sea Villas and the walk to their main restaurant is too far. You can also chill at the sea pantry if you are staying at the sea villa. Really nice small area for you to chill. Do note you are not allowed to bring in outside food, there will be a penalty if caught

5) Activities, their Activities are limited and subjected to weather as well. It really is just a relax and chill kind of vacation. I spend most of my time in the room and outdoor hammock.

6) Wifi, the wifi was pretty much 1/5. Certain timing was strong and certain timing it was non existent but i could understand as we are in the middle of nowhere at the sea so connection was pretty bad.

Overall, if you are looking for a romantic relaxing getaway do consider Kiki Beach! Its a good place for family to enjoy a 1-2 days as well.

I would like to give thanks to the staff at Kiki Beach for taking care of me and my husband for our recent trip. Appreciate alot!

Also if you need help with any trip planning, do approach Lunar Travel, she will help with everything and assign a driver to drive you from batam centre to the meetup point to go to kiki beach and bring you back to batam centre!",1024
1723,ChIJS2ZTSUyn2TERR48oDhqLb0o,Kiki Beach Resort Batam,MotoAngler,4,"The Journey - 3D2N

We had a return transport arranged by Kiki Beach from Harbourbay for ~40sgd per pax.
Roughly 2hours. 1.5hrs by Car, 0.5hrs on boat.
Departure timings defer as it depends on the tide.

The Service - 5/5

Staff at the Kiki Beach never fails to be friendly at any moment.
We were greeted with smiles and a welcome drink. Made our time there enjoyable.

The Room - 4/5

I cannot give 5 points as the water out of the taps were very yellow and smelled like iron/rust. It cleared as the days past. It was so bad that we had to use bottled water to brush our teeth.

Room and toilet was spacious and well decorated. This is glamping and not a hotel. The toilet was humid as there was not much ventilation.

The Pool - 3.5/5

The pool is a saltwater pool. However, it was quite filled with algae and mold. Throughout our time there, there were staff cleaning the pool but there was little progress. That being said, there were a lot of mold debris where you would swim.

The Food - 4/5

The breakfast buffet was very limited. However, the regular menu was enough. Food was well made and tasty. The price was affordable compared to many other resorts around Batam. It just takes awhile as they have to walk to your location which is quite far.

Side notes

The sky view at night was breath-taking. With minimal light, you can clearly see millions of stars above you. You will be able to fish on the jetty for ~15sgd. There are big squid at night, if you wanna catch them.",3282

1) I don't think so it falls under 2 star also... Terrible whole room smells of drainage. Changed room twice.

2) Toilet amenities is not properly measured and fix, can't sit on toilet bowl seat as it was fixed 5 cm next to the wall, those whom are bigger in size can't fit in.

3) Breakfast left with flies as there were no one for breakfast. Top ups very slow.

4) Taxi drivers are annoying once you step out of the hotel lobby, they will glued to you and ask for taxi ride in taxi, if you say no need and thank you, they are not happy.

5) Strictly no online grab taxi's as genuine grab drivers being bullied by the normal taxi drivers on the road as they will stop grab drivers from taking their passengers. NO GRAB TAXI BUSINESS IN BATAM!

6) I choose different drivers on my 3 days 2 night trip... Over there they are hard up for business especially with foreigners, this attitude first starts from the immigration (I was slaughtered) to my last day at batam Indonesia.

8) Avoid going to BATAM on the day of public holidays as you may get slaughtered if they see red or your departure vessels from Singapore land.

9) Good Friday became a Bad Friday for me. Join the normal queue even you need to wait for hours, if you want fast immigration check out, get ready for the slaughter, targeted reds with families.

10) They want revenue but service zeroed.",3126

The bathroom had a floor divider that was very tall on the shower, which could hurt your toes if you were not careful. The space around the toilet was very cramped... not a spot you'd want to spend for a long time because your knees and sides would be touching the walls.

The breakfast on the other hand was a little disappointment. They do have an egg station, but other than that the variety is not a lot and the food is not that great. The coffee is terrible. I would suggest to skip the breakfast and go eat at the nearby coffee shops near the wet market instead.

But as we opened our Room 1819 it was full of baby cockroaches running around when we open the door and it smell like a foul stale smell. I refused and requested for a change. they moved us to room 1810 which we looked around the corner of the room hoping nothing crawling in the room as my friend had her baby staying. it was dusty and smelled like what it is in the other room but not as bad maybe this room is commonly used compared to the other, its dusty. security guard took photos of the cockroaches in the previous room but nothing else.

Requested for baby cot but they didn't get back to us at all.

Next morning, we had someone scanning the key card and tried entering into our room. Lucky for the extra chain even though I've locked the door - it was a new customer a malay man trying to enter at 11.45am when the checkout is 12pm. We were shocked that someone actually opener and entered into our room!! Even he was shocked to see us in the room. In what world they give the new customer the card when the room is not cleaned and checkout is 12pm?

But perhaps, this made me mentally prepared for slow lifts, poor wifi, dirty towels etc. However, when I reached, I was pleasantly surprised I got my room early. But I was shocked that the lift was not working at all. Maybe that's why I was given a room on the second floor. It was a long walk to my room but that does not matter as it could happen in any hotel. The smoke stench at the 2nd floor lobby was really bad. (It went away eventually) Do note that the airconditioning is not a ducted unit but a wall mounted one. It took quite some time to cool the room. I was ok with the temperature, somewhat feels like a 24-25degrees but my partner found it abit warm and this was set at 16degrees. The sheets and towels are washed cleaned but for fussy people, don't expect much as you can tell there are ""stains"". Bed was comfy for me though. I did not bother watching the TV as it is too distorted for comfortable watching. TV remote controller also would not work. I also had to walk to the reception to ask for stuff such as extra pillows and toilet roll as the toilet roll in my toilet was used and only little was left. There was no phone in the room for us to call the reception. I could not open my curtains too since it was another person's house like just 1.5metres away from my window. Coming to the hotel with lower expectations will make your stay pleasant as the price is affordable (you can probably still find cheaper ones out there). It is a useable room which I would say is clean, very spacious and the service from staff were prompt and pleasant. When I cooled down and rationalise after all the bad feelings from the stench etc was gone, I found that the room was actually ok. However, personally I would not stay here again as I do not want to risk using the stairs.

Nagoya Hill Mall is not too far, around 10-15 walks.
The hotel room is good but there are a scent of smoke, even though all the rooms are suppose to be non smoking room, just turn on the AC and exhaust inside the room. It won't smell that bad.
The receptionist is very kind to let me know when my packages were arrived.
I bought some things online and asked to be delivered to the hotel.
Breakfast is good but no variation. It is the same everyday. I won't complain about that since it is more than what I expected.
Definitely will stay there again when I am in Batam.",3133

On the day of arrival at 11am, i received a message that the room that we book is under maintenance.  Our other options are either studio or family room. The studio was too small so we chose the family room (almost 30%more expensive than the room we booked initially) even when there was only 2 of us. The hotel gave a 50k rupiah discount upon my request.  I was fine with that.  I messaged them to confirm that the check in time was at 2pm so we went to spend our time at a mall and arrived at 3+pm at the hotel only to find out that our room wasn't ready.  We had to wait.  There was no welcome drinks, no discount vouchers for the massage package (it was written on the website that these will be provided when we book directly with the hotel).

1829,ChIJ-_8vSZuJ2TERaZDSXCOKJ3w,Asialink Hotel by Prasanthi,Paul Corrigan,5,"We have booked 30 nights at this hotel, partly because of it‚Äôs facilities but in great part to Mayang Kartika. Mayang was instrumental in us selecting Asialink due to her very sincere warm welcome when showing us around before deciding on booking and her willingness to help us in any way possible. This has continued from that moment to this when we are actually staying in the hotel.

This is only our second full day of our stay, but my wife and I felt the need to immediately submit a well deserved positive review of the hotel and it‚Äôs staff.

We have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and this was exactly what we needed at this time for our current budget as our long stay in Batam.

The customer service, friendliness, professionalism and desire to pro-actively offer help whenever needed from everyone we have met to date is exceptional and truly second to none.

The hotel is spotless, our room (junior suite) is spacious and well furnished.

Leisure facilities include a modern gym, very nice outdoor pool which is shaded over head from the sun. Excellent, modern and comfortable poolside furniture.

Room service choices are excellent. The food we‚Äôve ordered so far has been very tasty with good sized portions. Compared to the UK, prices are extremely affordable with really nice meals costing around ¬£5 including service charge.

There is a minibus service provided. Once again when we found that we had missed the scheduled journey, Maylang immediately organised for a driver to drop us off at our desired location.

There is so much to praise that I‚Äôve probably forgot something!

I apologise for the lengthy review, but in truth it could be even longer. In summary if you‚Äôre thinking of a stay in central Batam, look no further than the Asialink hotel.

Thank you again Mayling for everything you‚Äôve done for us and for making us feel so welcome.",3706

It's clear the management never check the rooms, the bedroom could be easy cleaned up, the sink was full off hear and never cleaned sins opening. Even being a long stay guest, if you forget to book the room you get the risk you need to move to an other hotel, what's happened.

To improve:
- drinks selection from the bars are too limited
Also the drinks not only few but very bad taste. For example the Sangria, whoever is doing it have never tried a proper Sangria.
- main room bathroom. I stayed in a two room apartment in which the main room had its own toilet. The design of the shower was awful as it didn't have a separate door so all the water was running around the toilet. It ended up with a high level of water as the inclination of the floor didn't lead it to the sewer properly. We ended up using the bathroom outside I'm the living room.

So where to start:
Ants in kitchen area
No toilet paper
One Spoon and one fork for two guests
Extensive noise in the corridor.
No view from the window except large wooden shutters and then looking onto another building.
Extremely slow attendance to request for assistance.
When we first checked in our dining table just about collapsed due to leg being loose on the bottom.
The only reason I gave this place two stars was because of the friendly service we received in the dinning area.
Due to medical emergency at home which required us to check out a day earlier, which we notified hotel of the night before, we were denied a refund of one night.
I am not very impressed with this accommodation and will be advising following travellers to avoid this property.

Staff - generally polite and nice.
Coffee - Breakfast coffee (nice thick and strong black coffee)

Not so good:
Private pool - didn't get to use it as the water was murky, despite the pool staff chemical cleaning it on the second day. Since we didn't get to use this facility that we paid for, we headed to Tiigo Beach Bar @Montigo resorts. Relaxing place, large infinity pool perfect for a dip. Also a nice place to catch the sunset.

Breakfast - 5 main options. 2 local (noodles and fried rice), 3 Western (eggs benedict on toast, American breakfast and pancakes). I like the coffee best.

Room - Really warm in the day even if the aircon is at 18 degrees. We were told it's because of the hot weather and because the resort is built on the water, the heat gets even more intense. So, I probably won't recommend you to plan spending the day in your room. And in our case, not by the pool either.

Housekeeping - Need to let them know daily if you want housekeeping. It's not an automatic service, we were told, to prevent cases of potentially missing items. On that note, they do have a safe in the rooms.",3619

There is a peranakan seafood restayrant about 5 mins away from the hotel. You just need to walk to your left and you will see it. No need to cross the road or anything.

Major shopping places like nagoya hill shopping mall is 5 mins away by gojek. Paid about 13000 local currency or S$1.30 for per trip. Love seafood is another must try! Overall pretty happy with the place.

Security staffs really took their initiative to escort guests out of the hotel especially at night. The room attendants were extremely friendly and attended promptly to my needs.
A cool relax place away from the buzzling nightlife.",2114
1887,ChIJXdZGVNWO2TERzPBgbuSAPU4,Batam View Beach Resort,Dian Ekowati,5,"I went there with my family (2 adult, 2 kids) for three nights. Overall nice experience. The staff named Nia is very helpful and polite. They took care my hotel and ferry booking. When we arrived at Nongsapura, the hotel staff waited for us and helped us with immigration. When I checked in, I got offered free upgrade for the room, which is nice. The room faces the view of ocean - which I really missed by now. There is a little sandy private beach behind the hotel, which is nice. and they offer some kind of activities (banana board, knee boarding, etc.). There was a little mishap as I was always asked to pay for kids' breakfast despite I already paid upfront - but can be solved by showing them my invoice. Would appreciate if they record this kind of things better.
Other cons is difficulty to get decent food in decent price. The hotel offers food which if you go with two kids for lunch and diner, will get my wallet empty by end of the day. But, this can be solved by using online food order (gr*b). The hotel offers taxi to go to town, I didn't use the service as I got friend picked us up for traveling to town.

1889,ChIJXdZGVNWO2TERzPBgbuSAPU4,Batam View Beach Resort,Fionie Chan,3,"Was looking for a laid back resort to rejuvenate for a few days. Had visited this resort over a decade ago and had fond memories so decided to revisit.

Pros:
- Quiet location away from the hustles around Batam town
- Lovely sea view surrounding the resort
- Friendly staff
- Free daily hi-tea / drinks (not sure if this is only for villa guests though)
- Breakfast selection was okay with a decent selection.
- Staff were very professional, live band and magic show continued on in the evening even though there was almost no audience.
- Buggy to pick up/drop off to and from the villa
- Has a WhatsApp communication system. Able to send your requests through WhatsApp, though it may take them some time to respond.

Cons:
- The 2 bedroom villa that we stayed in had their bedrooms and living room entirely separated. The living room was on the lower floor while the bedrooms were on the upper floor. This meant you needed to walk out of the upper floor room just to go to the lower floor room and vice versa, and each room needed a keycard to power up.
- Power trips happened throughout the day in the villa. Oddly though, after each power trip, the electricity will power back up on its own.
- The sheltered outdoor area (with deck chairs) of the living room on the lower floor wasn't maintained well. When it rained, water will seep from the upper floor balcony down to the sheltered area.
- Amenities are poorly maintained. Had wanted to play badminton, but the net was broken. The rackets also were not strung properly, and shuttlecocks were worn.
- Mosquitoes were breeding in uncovered containers at the outdoor courts. Staff who was informed merely shifted the container away from us. In his defence, I don't think he actually understood what our concerns were. But the hotel management will probably need to better educate their staff.
- Some water activities listed were not available. We had wanted to do rafting and but staff couldn't understand what it was even though it was on the suggested activities list and we were subsequently told it wasn't available.
- Rooms are old and not soundproof at all. One of the mornings, there was some event ongoing at the resort and we could literally hear everything that the emcee was saying from wherever he was. There was no notification from the hotel about the event either.

Summed up, I think the resort has great potential but alot more effort would probably be needed to maintain its facilities in good condition.",1791

In any other hotel, I would have lost my hand phone forever.  Thanks to the General Manager and staff at iHotel Baloi for going above and beyond to provide such honest service.

1971,ChIJI3lje4wn2jERJo_Abfxfzks,Montigo Resorts,A Wang,2,"Pros: Friendly staff, good service. Breakfast was good on one day.

Cons: Extremely overpriced. Food and spas will cost you at least double the price of anything you find outside, usually triple the price. Resort is extremely remote so they blocked off Grab and Gojek on their wifi and force you to use their overpriced taxis. They will claim on google reviews that they do not allow ""unregulated"" taxis into their resort like Grab, but the experience I had with the drivers provided by the hotel felt even more unregulated. One of the drivers tried to offer a drive to a ""massage"" (they get commission for bringing customers to ""massages"") and pulled the typical trick of claiming they have no change to squeeze an extra few dollars out of the money you give them. I have never ever experienced anything like that with using Grab services elsewhere on the island. If Montigo wants to charge ultra premium prices, they could at least ensure that the service matches that standard. Yes, it is a third party provider for the taxi rides, but Montigo Resorts hires them and should hold them to a certain standard. Breakfast is also inconsistent - first day was good, but food on the second day was pretty bad, and drinks were obviously made with instant mix. Overall, not worth the money paid.",18

There is a small safe in the room which weirdly cant be locked or closed so one of my family member hit their head but when we asked the staff the response was unhelpful

Same thing happened with the wifi as it was off but annoyingly only on our floor it seems and call centre was no help

We also ordered 2 room, 1 twin and 1 queen size but frustratingly get 2 twins room

All of this on our first day

Another note: swimming pool was closed for renovation during our visit. My kids had been looking forward to visiting the pool during our stay. So they were quite disappointed and this should have been highlighted during booking process. Also parking for hotel guests is very unideal.

Cons : staffs, breakfast, price

Price : 3/5 (consider expensive compare other surrounding hotels)
Room : 3.5/5
Cleanliness : 4/5

Tips : in my opinion the positive points of this hotel are only new hotel and location. Room itself is small but clean. In my room, the wastafel and floor drain are not working well. Bed is hard. Breakfast is using box like bento. Bread is hard, coffee is standard. Don‚Äôt expect more if you stay here. Staffs serve like an obligation, not serve with heart. When I check in at 15.30, I booked 3 rooms but only ready 1 room. I have to wait another hour. After insist and complain, then they give me rooms ready to stay. Before I complain, they said all rooms are fully booked. Why should you lie about it? If you know the basic of hospitality industry, dont lie and treat your guest as a king. Another bad thing, at noon, they turn off all the light in corridor, it‚Äôs dark event when sunny day. You can cut the operational cost however you still need minimum requirement for light. For the Manager, you must change your mind as if you are the guest, so you will know what should be improved for your hotel.

2154,ChIJW5b4Utj1aS4R0cjpgYUQazs,YELLO Harmoni Jakarta,Ika Hapsari,5,"When I searched recommended hotel in Jakarta in Tiktok, I found a VT that recommend this hotel. After checking the location and rate on travel apps, I decided to book a room for a night for business trip purpose. Why?
1. The rate is quite affordable for a hotel that is located in the city center, near Monumen Nasional (Monas), Istana Merdeka (president palace), Kota Tua, and other Jakarta popular landmark. Also it's also quite near from Gambir Station and Jakarta Kota station. There are several Transjakarta halte nearby. So the location is pretty strategic and easily accessible using public transportation like online taxi. The rate I paid for weekend stay was around 500-600k IDR which already include with free breakfast and amenities. The hotel itself is in the same building with Harris Vertu hotel and Harmoni Exchange Mall. If you need to dine or buy some neccessities, you can visit the mall by walk
2. Eventhough the rate is affordable, they provide complete facilities for the costumers. The standard room size is not really big, probably around 15m square. But it has a good city view from it's huge glass window. They also provide bath amenities, coffee&tea sachet, drink, mini refrigerator, brankas, safe deposit box, in-room sandals, small wardrobe. The public facilities are also available like restaurant, open working space, gym, playground, praying room, meeting room, ballroom, clean toilets, etc. I didn't explore much. The various breakfast menu are also satisfiying. The taste is also good. They have mostly Indonesian food like meatball, vegetable salad with peanut sauce (pecel), chicken porridge, fried rice, fried noodles, even jamu (traditional herbal drink)
3. The interior design is quite vibrant, modern with young vibes. Including the mural in their walls, decoration, furnitures, yellow-ish color domination, etc. The staffs hospitality is also good.
4. What I didn't enjoy much on my last stay was because the hotel was too crowded. Maybe because this hotel is pretty famous, the rate is affordable, and the service is good. That's why there are many institutions books this hotel for their event, that somehow all together in same moment. The receptionist of the hotel is located in the 7th floor, so the visitors should take the lift upstairs. Unfortunately, the GF lobby was pretty small as waiting room. But the plus point is that they have ice cream stall here. In one occassion when I was already so tired, I have to wait/queue for quite long for the lift just to go to my room. It was pretty much exhausting. Maybe this factor should be concerned if you want to book this hotel. Also, when I had breakfast, the restaurant was quite crowded. But luckily they have lots of table and refill the food quickly so the guests didn't run out of food.
All in all, I give rating 8/10 for this hotel. I probably will make video review on my Tiktok @taxveller",2189

Because we want to get beauty shoot in our room, so we decide to book their business suite room to have bigger room with nice view. But they give us the room with no view at all, there is a curtain and we think it is a big window behind the curtain so we can get nice lighting for our photoshoot, but behind that curtain it is only a big wall without window. When i ask the staff, he say that it is to prevent suicide. Wow, i really didnt expect that answer.
And for our wedding matrimony, it is held in their meeting room but the AC is broken and it is very hot inside, how can the hotel didn't check the ac condition eventhough they know that there will be event there. They try to fix the AC, but it is too late, my guest are not convenience because it is too hot inside.
For our wedding reception it is held in the hotel ballroom and we got so many complain from our guest that say the food stall are not delicious at all. One stall that have worse taste are 350 pax siomay. The price is 50k per pax and we think that the taste will good but it turn the taste is like only flour inside the siomay. Even the 10k siomay from streetfood taste better. They also  change our fruit to es teler. But the es teler is plain because they put too many water inside.
After we submit our complain to the hotel management, they only say sorry without admit their mistake.

A lovely mid-range find in amongst the fancier hotels and the low-key older, tired hotels past their heyday.

We checked-in quite late in the evening after a long day of travel, and staff were so friendly and welcoming, speaking both Indonesian and English.

We booked a deluxe double room with a city view. The room was quiet, clean, bright, modern and spacious with a huge bed, big TV with channels in both Indonesian and English, fast WiFi which never cut out, air conditioning and a lovely clean bathroom with a powerful hot shower. I noted that the bathroom had liquid hand soap and body wash in dispensers which is a welcome change from the usual disposable plastic mini containers that other hotels offer. Our room booking included breakfast, but as we are vegetarians the small breakfast buffet did not have many options for us, so we didn‚Äôt end up eating there. There is no room service, either.

The only negative I would say is despite the fact we had booked a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor, every time we came back into the room there was a very strong cigarette smell, especially in the bathroom, so not sure if that comes through the vents from smoking areas. We did mention this at the front desk and they sprayed the room while we were out, but that didn‚Äôt do anything. The smell lessened a bit after the air conditioning was on for a while though

After we checked-out, staff helped with our luggage and arranged our taxi to the airport. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will come back here during my next visit to Jakarta.",3529

There isn't any iron nor hair dryer available in the room nor upon request so make sure you find an alternative if need to. We didn't take the hotel breakfast package because some reviews claimed it wasn't worth it so we skipped and find local food instead.

2248,ChIJsfKgMQjzaS4Rwdpc9Q-u5XA,Wyndham Casablanca Jakarta,Yuka Anggraeni,2,"My husband and I are loyal guest of this hotel, we‚Äôve been staying at Wyndham since their name was still Park Lane.  It‚Äôs a dear home for us whenever we‚Äôre in Jakarta.

The breakfast is getting worse.
They used to serve smoked salmon, beef & pork bacon, Swiss cheeses, Brie cheese, great salads, and amazing pastries.  The main food was always scrumptious as well, but our last stay was a real disappointment.  We stayed there for a week.

It is with deep disappointment that I must express my dissatisfaction with the quality of the breakfast served at this supposedly 5-star hotel. My experience at this establishment was marred by the low-quality and unappetizing food that was presented to guests.

Upon arriving at the dining area, I was greeted by a selection of unappetizing dishes that looked like they had been sloppily thrown together without any care for presentation or quality. The taste of the food was equally disappointing, with undercooked and overcooked elements in the same dish, and an overall lack of flavor and seasoning.

As a guest for the luxury of a 5-star hotel, I expected a much higher level of culinary expertise and attention to detail. The lack of effort and skill in the preparation of the breakfast dishes was unacceptable and left a bad taste in my mouth, both figuratively and literally.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone who values a high standard of cuisine. The low-quality and unappetizing food, indicate a lack of commitment to providing a true 5-star experience. It is my sincere hope that this hotel takes immediate steps to address these issues and improve the quality of their food and service before any further damage is done to their reputation. (I rather they charge more for the breakfast and return it to its former standard).

I had to stop him from coming in further as my wife was only in her robe. Although she was already visible to him in the mirror.

Don‚Äôt walk into the room if someone asks you to stay out. My wife was in there. People expect privacy when they ask for it.

‚Ä¢ There is no evacuation route copy in the room.

The hotel also offers great value for the price paid. The location is excellent, with easy access to shopping centers and other attractions. The breakfast buffet was delicious and had a good variety of options.

I called reception to complain, yet they did nothing about it. At 5 am this was still happening so I took it in my own hands and opened my door and told the kid to be quiet and stop screaming as there are people sleeping and this is a hotel not a playground.

But the lightings, man, I barely can see anything, and its daytime. Still, i can park easy, but others, i don't know. The meeting rooms on ground floor is adequate.

Value for Money
Great Value for what you paid. Was upgraded a level above for no extra charge. Room and Bathroom was spacious. Bathroom was well equipped with bath tub, and rain drop shower which we love and a bidet (which we rarely see these days). Though we found the window wasn't well soundproofed. We stayed on 9th Floor, and could hear the loud revving motorbike engine at night quite clearly.

Friendly and Helpful Staffs
Shoutout to the male pool staff (can't recall his name) for the assistance with the jacuzzi and friendly chat.

Facility
We found out the late jacuzzi, sauna and steam room had broken down during early covid pandemic when the hotel was closed down, which still yet to be repaired. Though they have built replacement next door, where it used to be the old SPA area. You now need to make a booking to use this facility since it is now being shared for both female and male.

The new jacuzzi was a bit of a let down since it is now a small, portable 2 person jacuzzi and we had issue with the hot water.

Overall, we had a pleasant short staycation.",1906

The room was divided into 2 separate sides, on the left side was the bedroom & bathroom and on the right side was the kitchen & living room. Honestly I was really happy with how big the room is, but unfortunately it wasn't that clean. The floor felt so dusty, so it required me to always wear sandals in the room. Besides that, the furniture also looked old and many were chipped, but still usable. In the corner of the bathroom, there was termite droppings or the like that had not been cleaned, which was quite disturbing for me. No bath mat was provided in the bathroom so you need to be prepared the bathroom floor will be watery after you take a shower.

For breakfast, I was quite satisfied because there was plenty to choose from and it tasted great. The servings were tiny but they kept bringing out new stuff so it was always fresh. What's really cool is they had all these different variants of instant noodle so you could pick your own toppings - not many places do that.

Room: First, thanks to Mas Irfan as receptionist who assist my check in process quickly and made my requests came true. I got a clean room with a very good view (Jakarta Outer Ring Road and MRT railway view as i wish) from 14th floor. Second, thanks to Mbak Anisa for your great hospitality. Third, we got deluxe queen room with connecting door which is not soundproof at all, our neighbour room chit chat heard clearly even when they wash their hand :D Fourth, bed size for deluxe queen is like smaller than 180x200 cm i don't exactly it is a standart queen size.

Breakfast: Average taste of food.
Plus point for waffle and instant noodle stall (only Soto, not so many var) and kids playground.
Experience Day 1 (Eid Al Fitr day) food is complete but some table are messed, no one clean, it is look like lacked of staff or maybe due to the Eid!? Day 2, more messed, many empty food and crowded.

Facilities: Gym (3 devices) and swimming pool is not wide enough but ok. Sport towel available @receptionist. Toilet near to the swimming pool was very smelly and dirty.

However, our experience with the receptionist was unpleasant when we arrived at around 11 PM. Despite informing my friend to leave the key and make the booking in my name since I would arrive late, none of the four staff members offered any assistance or looked for our key. We were asked to provide our room number, yet we hadn't received it from my friend who left the key earlier. This made check-in uncomfortable and took longer than expected.

We were also disappointed with the food as it didn't taste good and was overpriced. Additionally, we felt unwelcome while using the swimming pool facilities.

Positive:
Of course the location itself, as it is nearby the famous Jalan Sabang in Central Jakarta, Sarinah and other Jakarta malls and landmarks.
For us, the services given by the staffs were excellent. They gave an upgrade room for my parents.
As other Ashley hotel brand, they have ironing and washing room.
Parking space for car not only in front of the hotel but also in basement (careful as it is narrow).
Late check-out was given.
Restaurant for breakfast has many varieties and the taste is okay.

Improvement/ Comments:
However talking about the room, the size and shape is too small and odd. It looks we do not have any space.
We expect that there is a pool as shown on the image. But it is no pool at the hotel. There is a small gym room. You can exercise there.
Care about empty hand soap at the room, tissue or amenities are appreciated.
Clean the floor under the bed at least once a week.
A nice room fragrance like in lobby should be also put in each floor or the room

No view from Room 314 and 317. But we do not mind.

then he gave me a room #302 that was still dirty and was being cleaned by housekeeping staff where the room was just used by guests who had just checked out.

I also found that the bed cover was not replaced and there was still rubbish in the room. However, the staff receptionist provided the room to me with the situation unprepared.

I then asked for another room that had been cleaned since the afternoon, but I still experienced a problem.

He gave my room number 303 with clean and neat room conditions but the problem that I experienced was that the room was very noisy because on the same floor there were rooms that were in the process of renovation.

I also asked the reception staff to stop the Project because I wanted to rest.
and the answer I got is that the new Project will be completed around 10:00 p.m. which is very disturbing due to the noise from the machines and also the tools used for the renovation of the room.

Bad experience is not just that when I see the towel I found in the bathroom with conditions that are not suitable for use, it can even be called a footcloth.

The place for breakfast is bathed in this same atmosphere mixing the modern and the old fashion, nicely done. However, the essentials are forgotten: tables that barely allow the knees to fit under it, 10 minutes to get 2 fried eggs, tea or coffee served in modern crockery that is painful to use. In short, everything is in the showoff. Finally, the rooms are particularly poorly insulated from the outside. As the building overlooks two huge roads in the city, the noise level is sometimes at the limit of tenability. I asked to change rooms. The second bedroom was equally noisy. If you like quiet, this hotel is definitely not for you.",5088

2nd Floor

Hospitality : 3.5 out of 5

The service is quite good (like other hotels you can leave items after checkout), but it's a shame that the phone was not working but was not repaired until checkout.

Room cleanliness : 3 out of 5

Room conditions and facilities:

Cleanliness: passable.

Signal provider: very bad, I use Telkomsel which is usually good, the signal is difficult here.

Wifi : very bad. Repeatedly refresh the device. The on/off switch between provider and wifi is still bad. So the battery runs out quickly.

Sound proof : very noisy in the morning till 2 or 3 pm. You can still hear the sound of chairs being moved.

Room cleaning service: if you don't ask, don't clean it (why do you have to ask for cleaning? Don't you have to clean it every day and refill drinking water and change towels without being asked?)

TV Channels : there are only local channels.

Bathroom conditions: if the floor around the sink and toilet is wet it's hard to dry.

Overall review : 3 out of 5.

When compared to Legreen Suite Kuningan (in front of Mie Aceh Setiabudi), it is better to choose Legreen Suite Kuningan because it is more sound proof, there are international TV channels, wifi and signal are better.",2122

The view amazing, at night I could see the Semanggi Bridge and Gelora Bung Karno. The food had enough diversity, they served it on plates and I had a microwave in the room. There was a smart TV, I watched good movies and had my daily routine of exercise.

Even though the room was already dated, the aircon wasn't digital with remote control, I thought it was well-maintained. For pre Christmas time, I was given a small cake and fruit platter as a gift.

Checked in 10 feb 1am, asked the front desk if i can borrow the iron for my shirts. He said it's not available to be borrowed but i can notify the housekeeping to do the ironing tomorrow morning, and he said that it was part of the service included in their pricing.

In the morning i was in a rush for work, so i called housekeeping and tell them can do the rush order in 10 min (it's just ironing 1 shirt and 1 pants), the house keeper yes he could.

However it took them almost 1 hour to finish, i tried to call the housekeeping and the reception and inconveniently they're unavailable. I was pondering if i should just go to the reception in my underwear (and almost do that).

So my cloth arrived late, i missed my important meeting timeline, and they still charge me for the ironing. So clever usage of word from the desk that when they mean it's part of the price, they mean they will add additional pricing and not included in the room price.

They have their own account for netflix, disney+, youtube, viu and even Spotify. So you dont have to logged yours in.
They also use Sensatia Botanicals for bath essentials, which is super üëè nice üëè (especially for me)
Booked the one with private garden, and the room was soo spacious. There are two aircons, so don't worry about the temp inside. No problems with the electrical socket too, there are many of em. They also served lovely breakfast in large portion.

Ok now for the (-)
The minibar fridge in the room wasn't that cold (they use the one with clear glass door, like showcase fridge) but just enough to keep your stuff chilled
The room lighting was a bit too dark (for me), but if you come for relaxing, or for a totally chill staycation, this may not be a problem.
When I got into the room, it smelled a bit musty, and the smell still lingers during the whole stay. But you'll get used to it eventually, I think. Cause thats what happened to me.
The staffs who took care of my food order from the cafe did not wear mask, even when he handled my food. Which was disappointing.
The room was too close to the street, hence, it was quite noisy (and..aromatic) at night, since there were many hawker food stall right in front of the house. You can hear (and smell) them from the inside of the room üòÇ

It's very well designed, has excellent amenities (sensatia botanica), and has a superb location (near all the public transport hubs). The room is spotless, reasonable in size, and decorated beautifully. We stayed in their studio room. Check-in went very fast and smooth.

However, one of the crucial parts of being a good hotel is sleep quality. The room is located downstairs, near their small caf√©, or just behind it. It is close to the entrance. The hotel itself is located in a busy corner of Taman Barito, where motorbikes/cars run 24/7. We stayed during the weekend; hence street vendors were everywhere. We don't mind that. However, the noise of the visitors/customers was deafening and went on the whole night. We cannot get a good night's sleep. It is such a shame. If you are coming with jet lag, I suggest you pay more to get the upstairs room or anywhere in the middle.

Management should think about making the downstairs room a bit soundproof. No matter how beautiful and pleasant the room/surroundings, it is pointless when you cannot sleep.",4379

Check in wasnt difficult but staffs are not as friendly as they should be.. no smile, no welcoming gesture, nada. But at least they did their job fine.. after some time they allocated me to a room, and i went up the elevator. Building is dilapidated, you can see how poorly it was maintained. When i tried to enter the room, it seems like the key is working but the knob wont open, after several attemps, we found out that the knob isnt properly attached and we need to repositioned it to fixed it.. finally it opens.
Room was quite spacious, big windows, great natural lighting.. but it was unacceptably dirty.. the pillow seems like someone used it already, it seems like they didnt change the sheet? Im not sure but at that point i convinced myself that would be unlikely.. but then i saw stains on the pillows, like it was coming from some kind of food cos there was a texture there in the stain which im sure it would be cleaned properly were they were washed. Its hideous.. i havent stayed in any hotel like this since forever. And not to mention the price is not like its super cheap (even its still not acceptable in cheap hotels as well). It's still comparable to many good hotels out there in jakarta. Worst value for money.
Then the problem did not end there.
When we checked out of the hotel, we were asked to pay the parking fee. I told them that we registered our car when we checked in and they keep saying otherwise. I expect them to take care of the problem for us, but instead they recommended us to go back to the receptionist again and sort things out ourselves. Its bothering to do so since we already register our car when we checked in. Arriving at the receptionist, the staff there told me that our car is already registered, then i saw another guest with the same problem with me. It took them some time to settle things out then back at the exit gate, i confronted the guy and he admitted the system is new and is problematic.. if so, have some flexibility.. i hate the idea that they know their system is problematic but it was the guests who need to take the hassle of going back inside to settle things out.

The hotel generally is good, but honestly the price-performance ratio was not satisfying at all.

While I felt that the hotel price indicates a high class luxerious hotel, I did not feel that way during my stay.

For sure, the rooms are tidy and nice, but for that daily rate, I expected a complimentary breakfast, a bigger room, and more facilities.

Iron & Iron board had to be requested and was not in the hotel room. Furthermore, the Iron could be used only for 2 hours before we had to return it.

Laundry service was available, but we did not use it since it was only a short stay. The pool was in the middle of the building next to the dining place, which made it feel uncomfortable and crowded. We did not use the pool because of that reason. A little bit more privacy / separation from the lobby would've been great.

2803,ChIJZ1OQFlvxaS4Rk89_jolEhGo,The Gunawarman,Ichsan Nurzaman,4,"Summary: Great mattress & pillow, great scent, skip the breakfast

Location 5/5: Hands down, one of the most strategic hotel in Jakarta simply because it's literally in Gunawarman. The food scene, the party scene, everything is nearby.

Room 4.5/5: I got a complimentary upgrade and my room somehow has this makeshift private balcony with the only access from this full-story window behind the TV. Cute space to just lounge around or soak some sun while eating snacks. Room is somehow scented, lobby too, in love with it. Mattress is so comfy, the pillows, esp. the main one, is very comforting. They have the sturdier option too if you are used to sturdier pillows so it really provides every type of pillow for everyone. Love the shower, a bit retro but very good pressure and temperature. The drain is a bit clogged though so maybe that's an area to improve. Amenities are all from Sensatia with Pepsodent as the toothpaste so that's decent. There's a separated area for toilet in the opposite section from the shower area, a bit retro too with the flush not located in its usual position but instead designed as this long metallic tube you can pull in the upper back left side of the toilet (you just need to see it for yourself tbh)

Breakfast 3/5: Nothing special. You get fruit platter, endless refill for your coffee and tea and then you have to choose 1 main course for the breakfast, so not your typical breakfast in a hotel where you ger buffet of menus. I ate the Western Breakfast (I forgot whether its English or American, pretty sure its American), the balsamic vinaigrette dressing on the salad is a tad too stingy and the lettuce is somewhat bitter. The rest (mushroom, sausage and egg) tasted as it should be. With the amount of foods nearby ranging from local food & snacks, pastries, etc. I think you'll be just fine if you skip the breakfast and try out other foods while getting some morning walks. But if you want to have your breakfast here and soak in the moment, well, up to you, pleasant seating experience anyway and if your room come with the breakfast, why not. The score 3 is more of the fact that it has no buffet rather than the flavor.",2176

For double bed, it joins 2 twin beds not large bed.

The rooftop is almost always full and you need to buy something to sit at the restaurant. So, not so easy to find a place. But overall it was a great stay for the amount of money too.

Some minus:
- Many strange knocking sounds from inside the wall over the day, sounds like a pipe thing.

The bathroom is clean and there are complete toiletries such as dental care, soap, shampoo and clean towels. There's free coffee and tea. The television is quite big too. However, the hotel sandals are a bit old and used.

We got free breakfast. The restaurant is quite spacious and there are different type of seats so you can choose. The food is also varied from local traditional snacks to western style breakfast with cereal or toasted bread. They also offer hot and cold drinks such as coffee, tea, juice and infused water.

The only shortages that I could find are you kinda could hear the sound from the room beside you if it's loud enough and the sound of the air conditioning is a bit loud.

Cons - this hotel has multiple floors with smoking rooms and in a non smoking room we had a piece of furniture with a cigarette burn mark (hotel staff advised the furniture may have been repurposed from a smoking room to a non smoking room), the lifts and common areas of non-smoking floors smell like stale cigarette smoke; the 'queen' beds are very small compared with the standard 'large bed' in Indonesian hotels - if you want to add an extra bed for a child the charge is Rp. 500.000 (I personally found the bed very hard and uncomfortable and different quality to other 4 star hotels in this area); hotel was under renovation during our visit (December 2022) and persistent loud construction like banging can be heard beyond midnight; hotel staff confirmed we were eligible for a promotional package before we checked in, but after check in the guest relations staff initially informed me that our booking was not eligible (although after double checking confirmed we were eligible); bathroom and particularly the toilet area is very small and awkward, it's also poorly ventilated; the furniture, fitting curtains and walls are not well maintained and broken or visibly dirty",817

The air conditioner is very cold which is VERY important to me. The water heater works VERY well too. For a small hotel, kinds of food for room service are various, there are ""sayur asem"", ""sop iga"",  ""soto ayam"", ""soto tangkar"", ""sapo tahu"", ""nasi-ayam"",  ""sop n sate kambing"", ""bakso komplit"", etc, and kinds of western food too. The breakfast is not vary but it is okay because for a small hotel, i think the food are quite complete and very delicous and they have a coffee machine that serve kinds of coffee, latte, even hot choclate! I am just a little bit dissoppointed with the service of the front office, less helpful. But to have a short staying to relax before going somewhere, it is quite okay because the room is COLD, the bathroom is CLEAN, the water heater is HOT, n the food is YUMMY! üòÄ Just a suggestion: i think they need to change the bed with new one.",5511

The location is outstanding, both to the sports complex, transportation (taxi stand, bus, subway), malls (in the fX Sudirman, but also Pan Pacific Mall), restaurants, and markets (Grand Lucky and market in the fX).

As far as the room, it was very good.  The bed was very comfortable, the WiFi was good (but did go in and out a bit), the TV had a decent array of channels, and the shower was good.  My only complaint about the room was that the temps on the A/C were set at a minimum 18C....I couldn't adjust it downward, which was very important, because in having a bright room the sun made the room pretty warm.  Also, the cold faucet in the bathroom leaked whenever I turned it on, and there was a clicking sound came from the wall when it was on.   Finally, the refrigerator temp was set at a higher temp, so cooling anything was difficult.

The breakfast was a very good value at 8USD, and I encourage people to try the traditional Indonesian food sections, as it has some great items.  The staff was great, as check-in was very easy.  However, being that the hotel is inside a shopping mall, I would encourage the hotel to put a sign out front saying that the hotel is open when the mall is closed.  If not for my good driver it would have been more difficult to get inside.

A few things were lacking though. We had to pay the restaurant and room service cash, instead of just booking it on the room. They have no clue about vegetarian and vegan food in the restaurant. We managed to get some, but the menu gave us almost zero choice.
One thing we really didn't like is that they pack their cutlery in plastic. Such a waste, especially when you know that on Lombok most waste is just burned.",2875

The only thing we missed were the morning greetings from the cows in the morning- they have been always special and kids have been looking forward to see them.

It could be a better place if the rooms were treated and don't smell mold. Specially, the bathrooms should be treated to get rid of the smell. The service people were nice and helpful though.

The resort is located in a stunning location, surrounded by breathtaking views of the mountains and the ocean. The grounds are immaculately maintained and there are plenty of activities to keep you busy, from hiking and biking to swimming and lounging on the beach.

The rooms are spacious, well-appointed, and impeccably clean. The bed was incredibly comfortable and I had no trouble getting a good night's rest. The bathroom was also spacious and had all the amenities I needed.

One of the highlights of my stay was the food. The resort has several dining options, all of which serve delicious dishes made from fresh, local ingredients. The chefs are clearly talented and put a lot of care and attention into each dish.

But what really set this resort apart was the level of service. Every staff member I encountered was friendly, accommodating, and eager to help make my stay as enjoyable as possible. From the moment I arrived, I felt like a valued guest and that feeling only grew stronger as my stay went on.

Overall, I would highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for a luxurious and unforgettable vacation. The combination of stunning scenery, delicious food, and exceptional service make this resort a true gem. Five stars!",2480

But for me who is used to more modern style (aka brighter and minimalist) I didn‚Äôt really comfortable staying in a hotel with cherry mold style for its furniture.

The whole experience is awesome. Sheraton is a 5-star service rating with the soft spoken Indonesians that puts everything in its right place. We had a blast on our stay  and meals as well as everything else.

I regret not to take enough photos to show how good it is. My son simply told me to enjoy the moment and to use my eyes to see instead of camera. I agreed!

The staff tried hard to locate us the day following being walked to another hotel and were able to track us down.

The room was A+ as expected of a 5-star hotel and the beach was incredible. We (knowingly) spent WAY too much on food as it was just so good. Try the vegan burger on Friday nights, it's amazing.

- The breakfast 10/10. Big portions and so good! We were impressed and delighted with the choices!

-Location was good, you feel as if you're in the jungle but you're not far from senggigi or anything else on a scooter.

- Rooms, we got the junior suite I think it was (can't remember) it had an entire deck and pool, just wow. You could watch sunset from there and it was amazing. Beds were amazing, view, everything.

- The ladies at the spa were also great, we got massages on our last day, so relaxing.

This place definitely has honeymoon romantic vibes, perfect occasion for it. I had only gone with one of my friends, it was so relaxing. But we both said we'd be back with our boyfriends!

Nizar is hilarious, Dian, Patrol, Wayan, Ketut, Okan, Vishnu, Muhlis, Nanda and all the other restaurant staff we met were all professional, appreciative and humble human beings. The food was incredibly tasty and delicious and so very reasonable. One day, the manager Mr. Zul took time out of his day and drove us around Lombok, we were not expecting that.

I would also like to mention Suman, Shahril, Heri, Abel and Ayu from the reception area and...they all made our stay extremely memorable and we would definitely be back because of them.

The food they serve for breakfast is very diverse, ranging from Asian and western food, you can't miss anything because what is served is really delicious!! They even have a floating breakfast, you can ask to have it and pay according to the price, I think it's worth it! I want to try all the facilities next time, starting from the store, and so on. really not enough just to stay one night there xx.

They take care of this resort very well, the cleanliness and friendliness of all staff is guaranteed, there are no acts of racism. In the morning I saw the staff cleaning the resort and they welcomed guests warmly and kindly, really like at home.

My honest experience when I stayed at this resort with my family, at that time I brought quite a lot of stuff and without asking for help their staff was very initiative to help with their hospitality, I really appreciate all that. I think maybe the resort does very good special training for all the staff. The atmosphere at this resort is very suitable to be used as a place to relax and unwind after work, family vacations, even honeymoons. They have two swimming pools, the first pool is very big and like a flowing river and the second is a pool at the end of the resort, like a romantic swimming pool with a transparent white tent, you can see in the photo I sent.

3084,ChIJn-F-puuvzS0RKBsPCs880Ok,ILLIRA Lite Hotel Praya,Alex Sedor,1,"There were so many rats scrabbling in the ceiling I couldn‚Äôt hear myself think. While I was considering whether to try to sleep through it with noise canceling headphones, I found bed bugs on the pillows. I had to leave in the middle of the night because I was too grossed out to stay. The staff did not seem surprised or overly concerned when I informed them of the issues. They complied when I insisted that they give me a ride or cover the taxi to a different hotel, which I appreciated. I was so excited about this place after a long hike. It looked beautiful and had good reviews!

Final note- prior to the rats and the bugs, I tried to buy water at the hotel (which has a 24 hour restaurant that will sell you bottles of wine and large Bintangs and everything else.) They will only sell you the little 500ml bottles for 30,000 apiece. (For reference, you can get 2L bottles for 10,000 apiece anywhere else in Indonesia including fancy hotels.) This hotel doesn‚Äôt even stock the larger water bottles and won‚Äôt just give you a glass of water. You can‚Äôt drink the tap water and there is absolutely nowhere nearby to buy water (you‚Äôd need to drive.) When I asked what my options were, the staff just laughed at me and said ‚Äúbuy these.‚Äù For such an ‚Äúupscale‚Äù hotel, this is completely unacceptable. I would have been happy to pay a ridiculous bulay (foreigner) price for the water but this went way beyond price gauging. (I drank 4 liters in two hours; I‚Äôd just come down from Rinjani!) I hope whoever runs this place grows a moral compass. Everyone expects and accepts hotel markups and to pay a foreigner price, but this level of extortion was pathetic and unethical.

So, to sum it up: rats, bed bugs, and you‚Äôll spend more on water than the room.

**I was very unhappy about the water situation, and prior to the rats and bugs fiasco one of the staff drove to buy me water for a fair price (20,000/4L.) That was really great service- so above and beyond- and I really appreciated it! I hope he finds a more worthwhile place to work!",284

The architecture and design is stunning, and each room is equipped with all the amenities you‚Äôd need for a beach staycation.

They have their own lobster farm which allows them to offer a delicious fresh lobster BBQ, and their a la carte menu features a wide variety of local and western dishes.

3130,ChIJ9QShAH_pzS0Rvj-_E6zli44,Kalandara Resort Lombok,Zahid Zameer,5,"This is a great accommodation for a few reasons. Communication with the hotel via WhatsApp prior to arrival makes it easy to anticipate the logistics required in getting to the hotel. I had run into problems getting a prompt reply via FB and IG, but once there was a WhatsApp chat, it was smooth.

The hotel provided a free pick up from Senggigi Pier, which was great for us coming from Bali. Ajis, who met us at the pier was extremely helpful and friendly. We then met Najwa at check-in who has been fantastic in her service to us.

The rooms are spectacular, but do take note, that it is perhaps not too family-friendly in the one-bedders. There are a lot of exposed areas, including the bath tub and shower area. There are blinds to protect your privacy (from the rest of Lombok) when using the bath tub, but we actually could see into a shower area of one of the villas when coming up the lift. Fortunately, there was no one showering. The pool and outdoor area of the room gave us spectacular views of the ocean and many times, the wind was extremely strong, which toppled the amenities at the shower area.

The lift to the rooms. This is one lift I will never forget. Such a unique design, traversing diagonally at an incline, almost similar to the climb you experience at the start of a roller coaster. It is rather open so you get increasingly fabulous views of the ocean below and across. It is a truly unique experience and we did not tire of the experience over 3 days. Superb! Can be quite a wait as one lift serves everyone.

The breakfast at the restaurant was delicious, but the service not equally there. Understandable perhaps , given that there were events happening some staff were new.

Overall, we can overlook the imperfections given the spectacular views and well-sized rooms! Special thanks to Najwa, Ajis and your ""boss"", whose name I did not get.",5194

Rooms.. for a 5 star resort it's not maintained well, alot of things were broken/incomplete in the room. Can see a major lack of maintenance in the rooms.

Great individual bungalows made out of wood. The bungalows were clean and spacious. The only downside is the bathroom. Bathroom is outdoor (surrounded by tall walls) which means lots of mosquito bites everytime you need to use the toilet, shower or sink.

Amenities:
A. The pool was nice and always clean. Staff were friendly, just keep in mind some have limited English.
B. Breakfast consisted of 3 options only: western; Nasi Goreng (chicken fried rice with egg on top); mi Goreng (chicken fried noodles). Vegetarian substitute can be done. It comes with fresh made juice, fruit plate, coffee/tea and water. The first day we didn't get fruits. The third and fourth day we didn't get water. A bit odd there but could be due to whomever were on duty.

Thanks to this application for the promo price I got. It was less than IDR 225k a night. If you also get that face, maybe you are as lucky as me. I could say the location of this hotel was not far from the beach. The registration went smoothly. At first, they gave incorrect room type (deluxe room?). A moment later when I get into my room, they called me and informed that they put me in incorrect room type and asked me to change the key in the front desk. I really appreciated what they have done even before I complain.

Generally, I enjoy my stay here because of how much I paid versus what I got. The room was very (very) spacious. I liked its spacious bathroom, hot water, the furniture, It was exactly the same as the photo they put in the Trav3l0*4 application. I liked the scent of the towels they provided. The cleaning room service was also available in daily basis. The front yard was also gorgeous. Many trees here.

However, some things need to be put in attention by another guests or to be improved by the hotel management.
1. The toitetries was not fully provided, they only provide towel for two (2) guests and shampoo or body soap of which unfortunately, I do not like the scent.
2. Mineral water was not available in room and water dispenser was not availabel either in the corridor.
3. The TV channel was only three or four channels. They used indoor TV antenna. No idea whether it was because of it or not.
4. Yellow stain observed inside bowl of toilet seat. I believe that it will be disappeared if brushed.
5. A bit problem in basin drainage in which located in the bathroom. The water did not drain when the basin used.

The friendliest staff you‚Äôll ever meet that make the effort to get to know you and learn your name. Delicious food all day long especially the afternoon tea with tropical fruits. Beautiful villas with outdoor showers and air conditioning to keep you cool. Amazing infinity pool to view the sunsets and a nice beach although not the best for swimming but still clean with warm water. Secluded but you never feel disconnected from the local area and culture. Could not recommend enough and we will return shortly.,1539
3173,ChIJLXaSLijozS0Ru7JGYD4BeTc,Jeeva Klui Resort ‚Äì Lombok,Joe Dimont,3,"How much I would love to give this resort four stars but I just can't.

Positives
- friendly staff that are helpful with sincerity
- beautiful and tranquil grounds and a lovely beach that is cleaned daily. Good for snorkeling (saw a turtle from the shore)
- the food was delicious, we only ate the Indonesian dishes but we loved all of them.
- as a tourist coming from California the price was very reasonable

Negatives
- service is incredibly slow. Be prepared to wait half an hour between courses at the worst of it. Plan 2-3 hours for dinner.
- toilet in the room was leaking and kept running even though we had someone take a look at it. Possibly the cause of a pongy odor that lingered in the room.
- air conditioner thermostat did not work so there were two settings: freezing or off
- we booked a spa treatment with the front desk a day in advance but when we visited the spa they did not have our reservation. They were able to fit us in over two days.
- we were told we could pay for tours with the hotel and charge to the room but at the end of the tour were told to pay the guide in cash which we did not have on hand.

Overall the resort has so much promise and potential but failed to deliver. It didn't ruin our vacation and the sunsets from the beach and the food will forever be great memories. However, I would not visit this resort again.",2447

The staff were really friendly across the whole resort and the food and drink was good and reasonably priced. The beach was great and the sea warm. A little too shallow for and decent snorkeling but plenty of coral and fish to see. The only issue we have with this beach is you get hassled to buy local goods every 50m. We did support some of them but they take time to get the hint you're not buying.
We met the owner, Marcel, who was a true gentleman and really interesting to talk too.

Hotel is small and staff is amazing and warm, the owner also lives there and is always happy to have a nice chat. Everyone is so welcoming and helpful. Place is clean and quiet. There is a nice pool with some sits. There aren't any mosques in the area so we could finally get some proper sleep there :) the wifi was also very good in this accommodation. They provide you with access to the unlimited drinking water which is really good.

Disliked ¬∑ The only thing that we were not very comfortable with is a bathroom - it is really nice but not very practical - it is very hot there during the night and it does not cool down much at night. There is no ventilation there and on a hot day it is a bit of a challenge. We could also use some small fridge in a room.

Clean rooms, very similar to pictures, good air con, a freshwater shower, bathtub, four pillows per bed and the beds actually had real blankets, not just sheets. All the bungalows have balconies. The grounds are immaculate and well maintained. The pool was clean, and steps from the beach. The hawkers selling their stuff aren't allowed inside so its definitely a nice reprieve from lying on the beach. However, they will come up to the gate if you're by the pool and try to sell you stuff, but they're far enough away that it doesn't really bother us.

The only strange thing is that if you look up this place and follow Google Maps, it takes you to the wrong OYO. I put a picture below of where it actually is, around 15 minutes away from where it claims. If you tell your taxi driver ""Mascot Beach Hotel"" they should know where to go.",1031

Marble floor has obvious stains, resting pillows have foul smell (not been washed for very long ). The shower gel, shampoo and conditioner do not seem to be befitting for a 5 star hotel. The a la carte breakfast is actually very bad. I can get better nasi goreng anywhere else for much cheaper any time of the day.

For the price we were expecting good facilities, but unfortunately since we checked in internet didn't work AT ALL. We asked its management team to give us a solution, but what the manager said was just asking us to be patient. We were ""patient""  enough for about 5 hours, and still, there was no solution. We decided to leave that night after the female manager (unluckily we didn't remember her name) gave us IRRITATING REMARKS and THREW TANTRUMS to us. For such a resort, the manager FAILED to keep her guest due to HER UNPROFESSIONAL AND EMOTIONAL attitude. Keeping such a manager is a BIG LOSS for puri hotel senggigi. She is a WASTE for this hotel and its team.
The front desk worker was so helpful and so polite, though! And the garden is not too bad. And that's why I still give 1 star.

Ahh, one more thing, the beach behind this resort is one of the most awful beaches I've ever seen.  It is very close to a dirty (yach!) river, located just on the right side, and the sand is pure black, and the surroundings look dirty.

Worst stay here so far and I have been traveling for 7 weeks now. It is more expensive than other hostels/hotels because I wanted to be a bit more comfortable from all the traveling however you should better go to a mixed dorm hostel than this horrible hotel. My first night I came in and my AC did not work and there was a light beaming as a result I could not sleep. Next day I mentioned this and luckily they changed me to a different room. However even though this AC worked it was hot air... Further the bed was really hard (but that was the least of the problems), the radius of the shower was not working so even after 30 minutes you would still not feel clean, the room had an awful smell, the hygiene of the whole room was disgusting (especially the bathroom), the rest of the property was under construction so the power fell out a lot of the times, the wifi was barely, not, working the toilet did not flush and after telling them this 3 days in a row I was tired of staying here so I decided to go somewhere else.

I mentioned this two nights before leaving and asked if I could get my money back for the nights I would not be staying there anymore. The receptionist said it was okay however when I went to check out they suddenly were being very difficult. They gave me all sorts of excuses and then I was just sick of it so I threatened to wright a bad review and then all of a sudden I could get my money back.

So yes it might seem cruel of me that I am still writing this review however I think they treated me very bad and people should be aware when booking this hotel.",882

The architecture of the hotel was modern, yet cozy, creating the perfect atmosphere for a relaxing getaway.

The staff at Somewhere were exceptional, providing the best service I've ever received at a hotel. Their attention to detail and willingness to accommodate my needs truly made my stay memorable.

The food at Somewhere was also top-notch and definitely surpassed my expectations. The restaurant's menu offered a variety of dishes, each one prepared with the freshest ingredients and bursting with flavor. I have to say that the food at Somewhere was some of the best I've ever had in Lombok.

The owners of the hotel were some of the nicest people I've ever met. They were welcoming, accommodating, and genuinely cared about making sure their guests had the best possible experience.

Overall, I can't recommend Somewhere enough. If you're looking for a truly unforgettable experience in Lombok, this hotel is definitely the place to stay. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!""",5101

The gates were closed and it looked like closed. We had to find local people who after some time trying to call many people , managed to find a manager.
We found it weird experience, even if we know they go sleep early but you run a business of guesthouse. They phone number doesn't work.
When we came we found it empty ,no guests but many employees.
We spend enjoyable night as it was quiet and decided to stay more nights.
This place is relaxing, beautiful, on the beach. The hut is basic as expected, with salty water in tap.
However, few things were disturbing and ruined our syst there ans need improvement.
First, the noise. We were hoping to find leave but one day were awoken at 6am by loud music from restaurant , by employees.i asked to turn down. But day was ruined! 6am!!!
Secondly, they burn the garbage in the garden right in front of the room, the bad toxic smell comes to the room in the morning! Again, this is horrible experience. We have experience travelling in asia and they often do it. They forget they rub the business and people come here ,pay money to find peace. Not the mountain of burni g rubbish.
Third, on the weekend there is a lot of noise from Indonesian families in the morning who wake up at 5am and start screaming and shouting. Unbearable and impossible to sleep ,childreb screaming next door.

Good and spacious pool with sun beds. Availability of a gym. Wifi sort of works in the room and around the hotel. Speed ~7mbps. Friendly staff. Great location.

Cons: The lock on room doesn't feel very sturdy. We had trouble with it and had to call someone to fix it.
Even the fresh bed sheets seem to have stains on them. Had it changed but the new ones came with it.
Breakfast is alright, food is a bit greasy for my liking and didn't seem very fresh.
The body soap/shampoo they provide doesn't seem to lather or have any scent.
They have a convention center at the end of the resort, so you have a lot of people walking by which causes a lack of privacy.

The services work, but could use better management and organizing. For eg, the bar at the pool was unmanned most of the time and someone had to be called to get drinks and towels. More information should be provided during check in. There is no 'clean my room' or 'do not disturb' system.
They could figure out an alternative entrance to the convention center to avoid non residents from entering hotel premises.

I have worked in the same industry for 30 years and felt I gave the team every opportunity to correct the issues, Sadley they failed.
The issues we encountered include but were not limited to:
1. When we arrived the cold drinks served were warm.
2. The main air conditioning unit in the villa lounge was leaking making the floor wet, slippery and dangerous and as we had 4 children with us this was a real concern. This was reported when we arrived and was not fixed 4 days later when we left. I reported this 5 times.
3. Staff toilet leaking into the lounge, this was fixed same day.
4. Fridge not working - was fixed same day.
5. Main bathroom shower broken, not fixed after 48 hours when we left.
6. Kids room flooded just when it rained.
7. Taxi not available to pick up guests as agreed.
8. Alive and dangerous Scorpion in the shower, we removed it.
9. Cockroaches in the bath robes, we removed them.
10. Staff watching my wife in the shower as there is no privacy. The General Manager did not seem concerned and said 'Yes more staff training is needed' and complimented a small portion of our food bill.
When we left I gave the general manager the time to explain, at the end after a half hour conversation I realized this was going no where and my time wasted on this had to stop. The views from the Villas are amazing and the Villas are spacious and nice but my advice - its not worth going to Selong Selo.",4526

We can experience the ambiance of sunrise in the morning as well as the sunset in the evening for the reason that it's located on a high hill. In addition, Selong Selo has several choices of villa types. We chose a 5 rooms villa with extra beds in order to accommodate all family members. In my experience so far, Selo Selo is the best 5-bedroom villa in the hills of Central Lombok. It's spacious, clean, and neat. Besides that, not many insects enter the villa like in other villas.

In addition, the wifi is fast enough, so it's perfect for workers looking for a calm and quiet place to get work done. That's the reason for me to stay longer in this villa.
Can we enjoy the place without staying overnight? Yes, we sure can. Selong Selo provides a restaurant that is open to the public so we can enjoy a delicious meal and a beautiful atmosphere without having to stay overnight in the villa.",3842

The staff welcome you with open arms and each morning and night made our time more and more special with their personal approach and having every member of staff calling you by your name.

The room was lovely. We opted for a villa closest to the pool and sea where the room is large, cool, beautiful private pool and stunning stone roll bath top.
The main pool has a wonderful infinity style to it where you can see the sea and even spent time in the water. I used the free canoes a few times as the view is spectacular looking into the mountains and volcano (sunrise is beyond special here).

The resort is very private, the food is excellent especially the Indonesian menu but caters for all. You can have massages by the beach hearing the sound of oceans.
I would also say it‚Äôs more of a luxury sustainable hotel and conscious of the environment and its surroundings where you will also see see locals fish in front of you for their family‚Äôs catch.

The hotel offers a day snorkelling trip around then Gili Islands and feels very VIP and private as well as having the option to do a diving session too. Looking at the other tour boats it felt busy whereas the resort one had no more than 6 people at a time so it felt very personal.

Jalal is the head of the restaurant. He knows to tell you al lot about the food and is very knowledgable. The food is all locally sourced. The food was brilliant!

When we left Jeeva Beloam to go to the next place of our journey, Rizal drove us. We made a stop halfway our drive at a local Sarong Weaver to learn more about the culture of East-Lombok. This was a recommendation from Rizal. This was an inspiring experience.

There is no noise from the building, sometimes I hear some noise from the road, but it doesn‚Äôt nerve me.

So, if you are in Koeta I highly recommend to stay at this nice place and enjoy your staying.

Also, a lot of good cafes near, if you even don‚Äôt have a bike you can easily reach them by foot)

About cleaning the room, when you ask the staff to clean your room, they will of course clean it. I think this it so common here (in Indonesia) clean the room only when you need it and I find it nice.",6016
3413,ChIJrz1HeM2pzS0RBPA93tswHBA,Lavella Villas,Dhan Doank,5,"Lavella Villas is a comfortable and quiet place to relax. Especially if we are on vacation exploring beautiful beaches in the Kuta Mandalika area. The location is still in central Kuta, entering the alley, but not far from the highway.

The hotel area is actually not large, but the arrangement is really good. This is what I like, the rooms are in the form of bungalows and the rooms surround the swimming pool. The pool is like an oasis. The surroundings of the bungalow are quite lush, lots of plants, flowers, very fresh sitting in front of the terrace. Not many rooms are owned, so the atmosphere is peaceful, not noisy and not crowded.

Another thing that I like is the affordable price for a comfortable place like this. There is 1 Bungalow which has 2 large beds, it can make four of us. We stayed in this room. Besides being able to be used with friends, it is also suitable for families. The rooms are clean, complete facilities, AC, TV, and others.

A pleasant experience while staying at Lavella Villas. So, I take a lot of photos here. Thanks.",1345

The lobby is cozy, and I love watching Koi fishes down the halls. The balcony is serene, and makes it easier to visit neighbour's room beside you... If you're that type of guest...

The one thing I complain about is the toilet. They don't give extra small towel as a mat so the toilet gets messy easily. Also, missing hangers! There are no hangers AT ALL in the toilet. How come? Where am I supposed to hang my clothes while I'm in the shower?

In the bathroom toilet was full all the time, and we couldn‚Äôt switch the light of.

On the second day, we informed the owner about the light in the bathroom, but nothing was done about it. On the third day we changed the rooms, however it wasn‚Äôt good either. In the second bathroom the water from the sink kept coming all the time.

We could use a kitchen, but it was dirty.

Also, the wifi connection was terrible, we‚Äôve been traveling for 3 months, and never had such a bad Wif as here

We also rented a bike from this place, we didn‚Äôt sign any documents, but the staff seem to be really friendly. The first bike we‚Äôve got had really bad brakes, so we asked if we can change. We got another one ( after driving we found out, that the breaks were a bit faulty as well, and felt unsafe to ride). On our third day we asked to extend the rental for another day. When we were checking out, we got informed that we can‚Äôt use a bike, if we‚Äôre not staying in this accommodation. Obviously, we weren‚Äôt noticed about it before, so we had to give the bike back.

Baik and Lisa are very friendly and both were really helpful whenever we needed information, they also helped getting a car on our last day to go to Lembar harbour. It was great to chat with both of them whenever we had an opportunity for that. Depending on the hour of the day, there may be a few dogs barking at you when you enter the path from the main road to the guest house but if you have a motorbike, they simply bark and follow you but they are not aggressive.

Villa Bumi - that's how our villa was called - is a beautiful two level villa with a good size private pool and stunning bathroom. Villa was a good size and even a bit too big for us :) it was very clean, had a lot of space to put your staff and some nice sarongs for pool and beach were also provided. We loved how quiet and lovely it was. The staff was amazing and they really made sure our stay was lovely and without any hassle. Our villa had a sitting space on the first level where drinking water, tea and coffee were provided. There was also a small fridge where we could put our food, some books to read and everything looked really beautiful. That was a place for us to relax, rest and enjoy our last days in Lombok. The only regret was that we couldn't stay longer but we will make sure to book in advance next time - because we will definitely be back in this place!
Villa is few minutes drive from the beach (I think around 15 mins walk) but they have some good scooters to rent in a good price if needed :)

Disliked ¬∑ Our stay there was perfect and we couldn't ask for more but if we could then it would be nice for them to take care of the road as it is really bumpy to get to villas when you leave the main road. The accommodation is hidden in the jungle and it takes some good driver to get there - especially on a scooter. Also bear in mind that as I mentioned above villas are hidden in the jungle so there is no view apart from the trees and some local cows - which are lovely! There is also no restaurant and as some restaurants are available in a walking distance the road is not so good and walking can be a challenge especially when it is dark. It is really good to rent a scooter when you stay in this villas.
Villa Bumi could also use some small kitchen as there is more than enough space to fit one into it :)",2980

Breakfast was delicious, and they made it look lovely.
The staff was friendly and eager to assist.

For me, the problem is the location.
If you can't ride a scooter, walking at night would be risky because the location is not on a main road and there is little light at night.

The price they gave us is comparable to a five-star hotel. I prefer hotels to this location because it doesn't have a restaurant.",4831

The bed is very very comfy as well and the AC is of high quality. The wifi is stable enough to have meetings and the TV with Netflix is a great plus as well. The shower is great and the bathroom is very spacious and clean as well.

The breakfast is very good, the staff is so kind and the owners are very friendly. I was added to a private WhatsApp group so I could ask them anything I needed (scooter, taxi service, breakfast,...). The location is also very convenient and quiet.

Room Quality: the room is 26m2, same for all rooms in here, the only differents is the perks included with it such as breakfast, gym access, valet parking. The room is comfy and good. View from the highest level is to Jalan Letjend S Parman, road as it is nothing interesting. (5 stars)

Room Rate: fairly affordable, range from 494.300 (12.12 rate promo) to 1.058.686. (5 stars)

Concierge Service: the team is ok, can handle customer well. Two disappointments from my experience are first, this hotel does not have regulation to keep your delivery item from online delivery either for foods, goods, etc so you need to get it directly from the driver instead. And the second, the doorwall is quiet thin so the noise from outside will be heard. (2 stars)

Housekeeping: they only provide 2 bottle of 600ml water and can only ask one more additional for free, its pretty low intake of water for a person alone (I encourage you bring your own water if you need more, which you do). Also the service is a bit long, maybe because the hotel occupancy is pretty full due to several events here so its understandable. (3 stars)

Location: in one of the main road of Malang. But pretty far to the city center of Malang. (4 stars)",3101

Hotel looks a bit old from outside (washed up colours). Parking had little space and I was asked to move (quickly) the car one day after arriving.

I thought it was a hiccup where the chef accidentally dropped some salt on certain part of the omelette, but no baby noo, it was salty in every single bite. I like salty food but it was beyond tolerance, enough to cause gustatory hallucination to be frank. I believe you can do better next time.",5769

3677,ChIJk6VMciMo1i0RgNaABoKDp9Y,Grand Citihub Hotel,Nurul Fikri,5,"If you have an experience of staying in hotel on Jakarta and looking for the same room/vibe, this hotel is great for you!

I stayed here in a Nano Room for 4 nights and this is my Pros and Cons staying in Grand Citihub Hotel:

Pros:
- The room is simple yet so perfect!
While I stayed in Malang, I have experienced hotels with leak toilet water, mold on the wall, floor that break in the middle, etc but only here in Grand Citihub, I came accross a room that has a clean and good bathroom, the floor is made from wood replica so you won't experience floor that break and also the wall and furniture here is so clean without rust and mold.

- The food is delicious!
Even though there is so many food that contain pork (the cafe even named ""Pork and Barrel"") but the food that is halal is super good! Me and my wife tried the ""Nasi Goreng Mawut"" and ""Nasi Goreng Seafood OX"" and we both loved it! It's so tasty.
*Please be careful that the food here has big portion so for someone who only eat a small portion to ask the cook to reduce the portion

- The WiFi here is super fast!
Every room has it's own WiFi router making the connection is stable and fast! It's good for you if you want to have a conference call here in your room

- The staff is kind
I have only talk with the trainee staff on the receiptionist and the cleaning staff and they both answer my question kindly and thoroughly

Cons:
- The hot water is slow
GrandCitiHub has hot water running in each of their room. But, when I stayed there I had to wait about 3 or more minutes after I turned on the shower before the hot water comes out.

- Water everywhere
The shower room only have a little bit height difference with the toilet/closet area so if you turn on your shower for about 3 to 5 minutes it cloud make the other areas wet. It's best for you to turning it on for ",3613
3678,ChIJk6VMciMo1i0RgNaABoKDp9Y,Grand Citihub Hotel,Awal Fadly,4,"I booked a Nano-Room type in this accommodation for three (3) nights and spent about US$ 67.95 (with breakfast). Its location was at Jalan Jenderal Basuki Rahmat No.56, Kauman, Kec. Klojen, Kota Malang, Jawa Timur 65119, less than 1 km from Malang Railway Station (approximately), across from BNI 46. I arrived here at 7 AM, unfortunately, early check-in was prohibited, unless a full charge was paid. The same condition also applies to late check-out. Fortunately, the baggage might be dropped off at the receptionist for free until the check-in time. The registration was fast, an IDR 200k had to be kept here as a deposit. They also gave me an IDR50k voucher for breakfast per day per guest which can be claimed at their restaurant on the seventh floor. I got two (2) vouchers since my room type was for two guests. There were three (3) room types here so far, i.e., Superior-King (two guests, private bathroom, larger room, with window), Nano-Room (two guests, private bathroom, smaller room, no window), and Driver-Room (one guest only, share bathroom, smallest room, no window, cheapest price).
Pros:
1. Toiletries were provided. The amenity was good, e.g., shower, clean towel, mineral water, and slippers.
2. Every towel, drinking glass, and glass in the shower room were covered with plastic. The towel was wrapped in sealed plastic, so it can be clearly differentiated between the new towel and the used towel.
3. The staffs were helpful and friendly. I was helped when I requested to change my current room because of the noisy floor (floor type: parquet).
4. WIFI speed was fast, and AC was OK. Every room has its own WIFI router(?).
5. The location was great, live street music performance was almost every night in front of this place, and it reminded me of Braga Street in Bandung.
6. SMART TV worked well. Instruction was also provided on how to use this SMART TV.

Cons:
1. It only has a non-halal restaurant. According to the information from their restaurant staff, only snacks such as tahu petis and fried potatoes are cooked in a different area from their non-halal kitchen. If you must have halal food, you can choose a room without breakfast and order food from outside. Furthermore, the voucher can also be used to buy soft drinks or mineral water.
2. The room was quite small for the Nano-Room type. However, the Superior King can be booked if you want to have a spacious room and window. Nano-Room type has also no window, both to the corridor and to the street (outside view).",703

On the first night, the next room played music really loud on 12 pm. We called the receptionist to complain about it and hopefully they remind the guest and the music stop. Another bad experience is when our last day staying, we realized that our hotel door is broken and can‚Äôt locked even though  we locked it manually on the inside. Its really dangerous remembering we bought so much valuable belongings such as laptop,jewelery, etc. After we complain, the staff give us another room to move in. The size of the room is smaller than the previous one its not really problem actually since it is still the same type and the door room is not broken. I think i wont ever stayed in this hotel again.

The door lock won't work with key card, so they gave me door key for the room.
First impression of the room is small and compact. The bathroom is almost dark, even with the light ON (light needs to be changed). You can see a small hole from the bathroom's ceiling and water's leaking the entire time I stayed there.
Pillow. It's so smelly, like it's been used for weeks. I needed to ask the staff to come inside and checked themselves for the smell. I asked for it to be replaced, but they said no more pillow available, so they only changed the pillow cover.

Don't bother to go for the breakfast option. If your budget is 450k for breakfast option, better go somewhere else.

- AC in 612 was leaked. We called front office to help send a technician to repair. And in the case there was no technician available, a doormat to absorb the dropping water. Neither showed up/delivered.

- there were 6 pillows in 206 (4 standart pillows + 2 additional small ones). But there were only 4 in 612. Note that we booked the same type of rooms.

The big plus of this hotel is the Bali ambience, nice outdoor area, and good scenery around. They have a number of pools as well. The staffs are friendly and helpful. Since most of the guests are family (besides couples), will be better if the hotel have some kids corner or playground.

What need to be improved: food. Not so many variety. Also, when my family was there, all the main dishes are spicy, no food can be eaten by my kid. I need to specially request omelet to the staff due to this matter (they do not have egg corner btw).

I got the business room, the very end one from the 5th floor. The first smell that I got from opening the door was smell of fungus (that wet and damp smell, iykwim). The corners are like the picture.
The bathroom is clean, but somehow the waters wont go down so it stays there which is annoying (I already turned on the exhaust, but still). AC & TV works well tho.

Surprisingly, I had a good sleep that night. It‚Äôs just the room that looks like it‚Äôs not managed well enough that disappoints me. If they can improve on that, I guess I‚Äôm seeing myself booking a room here if I‚Äôm ever do solo traveling to Malang again.",4790

But I'm dissapointed for the food. Yes, its quite a varieties of food for the morning breakfast but the taste is really plain and shallow. I try almost all the menu they offer, mostly Indonesian cuisines. There are plenty of rooms to improve actualy. The chef can go deep and making strong taste.

Upon visiting the room, there is a smell that reeks of odour that won‚Äôt go away, we‚Äôve called in someone to spray perfume around the room and the smell is still present.

I‚Äôve also read other reviews that pointed out the A/C problem and I completely agree with them, the A/C wouldn‚Äôt do its job to cool the room down, rather it made the whole room relatively hot and intensified the smell.

The windows are foggy but there is no view to see anyway, I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs the wall or the window that can‚Äôt absorb the sound, but it is really noisy especially when loud motorbikes passed by.

The cleanliness of the hotel was okay, however there are these ash looking debris that were scattered around the floor of the restroom. I‚Äôd have to spray it to get rid of it using a bidet. Talking about bidets, there is a picture that I took of the bidet.

Finally, I‚Äôve concluded that the WIFI of the hotel is shared throughout the whole floor. It was reasonably fast and would do the job for YouTube and/or websites. However, the connection would cut off every 1 or 5 minutes. It doesn‚Äôt really bother me since I had mobile data, but it is still frustrating for the visitors who doesn‚Äôt have any data.

I hope the hotel team would take this feedback and improve.",5412

I was relly disappointed with the hotel. At that time I found the service was very very terrible. There were 8 guests for a table. The food was just okay (not special) though the portion was quite small. My biggest problem was when we ask for drink. I need to wait more 20 minutes just for a glass of water and 40 minutes a glass of tea. What a service is that?! So, when the host asked all the guests to cheers up the glass, I was just cheers with an empty glass. Another case, the hotel just gave me 1 plate, 1 small bowl, 1 chopstick, and 1 spoon, for 6 kind of dishes. Even for food that need plastic gloves, it did not give me a tissue. And... the utensils were very bad condition. In East Java, we said ""gerimpis"". Then... No physical distance. If I didn't think my wedding couple friends, maybe I will leave that event.",3642

I booked 4 beds via Agoda (got 68k price per bed). You can confirm the booking first with the admin through Whatsapp, and they're really friendly.

We arrived at the hostel at 7 a.m, and they're allowing us to put & leave our bags/suitcases at the front desk before check-in time.

Exterior wise, it looks like an abandoned building from outside. Because the first floor and building next door is empty. But once you come to the 2nd floor, it looks promising. Interior wise, it looks minimalist with industrial vibes. The shared area was fine. The room was okay, it's fair with the price. But the bathroom still needs improvement and maintenance in terms of cleanliness. They gave you a towel, access card, and locker key (bracelet). The locker was really big (fits a 30"" suitcase). The AC was really cold.

Unfortunately, the check-out time is too early (at 11 a.m). And there is a late check out fee (50k). Even though, they're still allowing us to check out a couple minutes after with no additional fee. It's better to reconfirm with the front desk if you wanna check out late.

3948,ChIJ3Qju_CQo1i0RJT4o1nuJoD8,Hotel Trio Indah 2,Nurul Fikri,5,"I have the best sleep ever in this hotel!

The bed is soo comfortable, even my wife said so. We've been trying out about 3 to 5 budget (but nice) hotel here for our holiday here in Malang and here is the Pros and Cons staying here in Trio Indah 2:

Pros:
- It has the best bed in every budget hotel!
I stay in room 113 and the bed type is soft, with big and comfy blanket and also the pillow is bouncy makes you sleep immediately.

- The hotel has kind staff
Usually staff on other budget hotel only asked ""Is your room need to be cleaned?"" then if you said ""No"" the staff will leave. But here in Trio 2, I got asked with details question after that such as ""Do you need more towel?"", ""Is the kettle working fine?"", ""Do you need more water bottle?"", etc.

- It has working hot water
The timing for when the hot water running in the shower is usually slow for a budget hotel. Usually you need to turn on your shower then wait for a couple of minute

Cons:
- The WiFi connection signal is soooo bad
I dont know is it because I sleep in the corner room or something but I barely got any signal when staying there. They should add a router for every room so the signal is good. (I try the wifi on the lobby and it works just fine, probably just a signal issue)

- The room got mosquito (a lil bit)
It's best for you to tidy up ur belongings when staying here and if you sleep for more than 1 nights like me, I think it's a good idea to take up on the offer when the staff asked whether you need the room to be cleaned.

- The old McDonalds building is kind of in the way
When I first came here I tell my wife that the hotel looks creepy mainly because the McDonald building on the left but after I stayed there I don't feel like that anymore

- The door lock is kind of hard to open
The door sensor is kind of hard for you to get used to. Even I asked for the staff twice to open it for me and after that they taught me on how to open the door. I got used to it now and I could open it by myself",3613

Location : very strategic, has mcd and the famous sate gebug within walking distance.
Room : wood panel floor, comfy bed, soft pillows, spacious room and clean bathroom. They have wide selection for TV channels. I have no complaints for the room, the only downside probably the amenities, extra charge for extra towel, well, it's to be expected for this hotel with very affordable price.

3955,ChIJ4XKKx6OBeC4R6fKE2jfgXBc,Kapal Garden Hotel,sonia dewi,5,"We had a wonderful stay in the hotel.
We loved :
- the cool exterior design of a ship
- friendly staff members were awesome. We feel welcomed by the receptionist and restaurant staff and interns. Special shoutout to Hasan who was warm and courteous.
- We booked the deluxe room, it was big, clean and comfy. Extra kudos to the designer, thoughtfully added a layer of floor covering so that we dont have to step on a cold floor. All the room amenities worked well
- situated next to an amusement park. Even though its old, kids loved the swimming pools. Water in the pool is taken from a natural spring which meant the organisms living in that spring came along too! We spotted a few fishes in the pool and the kids were excited to swim with them. There is another pool (extra 15k perpax) newly renovated with few big sliders, they were fun!
- located close to Jatimpark 3

We didn't love:
- that its not right in the heart of Batu, which was our mistake for not paying close attention to the maps. If you are looking to stay in the mountain area, look at hotels around Museum Angkut (recommend batu villas and resort, beautiful and cheap!). Its colder around that area. This hotel is further down the slope so temps are normal, rather hot during the day.
- surrounding hotel area is dark and creepy at night
- breakfast is only so so. Variety and taste is just average. Stay away from fruits if you are eating after 9am, gets bad real quick.

Overall, we would recommend the hotel for families with kids! Its a good selection for those looking at a quick getaway.",5891

Incidentally, I haven't had the chance to try it yet, so I can't give a detailed assessment yet. As for the breakfast menu, it tastes good, maybe just a variety of food, which in my opinion is lacking for a 5-star hotel class. From my experience staying last week, if there are any deficiencies, the process of refilling food is a bit late, so there is a waiting time.",2040

First the hotel is just beautiful. The colonial architecture is stunning and the rooms are very nice. This is definitely a hotel that has been well cared for. We stayed in the Premium Room which was amazing. We had a small veranda and a King sized bed. The room itself was excellent and very quiet.

The layout off the hotel did cause us to get lost a few times either trying to get to our room or find the main lobby. It was a bit confusing but once we learned the route it wasn‚Äôt a problem and made exploring the hotel fun. The architecture  both inside and outside the hotel is very beautiful.

Our room included a breakfast which was buffet style and very good. The food was delicious and there were lots of selections from traditional Indonesian dishes to Western fare. Service was excellent.

The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of several restaurants and we enjoyed the food at AB Kitchen European Food just down the street which was recommended to us by family.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful especially the front desk staff.

Overall a wonderful stay but too short. I hope we can come back to Malang and stay longer at The Shalimar as it is a wonderful hotel and highly recommended.",3097

It depends on AC which luckily work,  the best thing I've got in that room.  The hot water didn't work in the evening. But the water also seemed to leave sticky feeling when I washed my hands so I chose not to shower at all there. The outlet to charge your phone doesn't have a place to put your gadget anywhere.
The check out time was supposed to be at 12, but the water was turned off at 11, and I had to wash in toilet with 'black water'.  Luckily I got tissues and mineral water left to finish.  I wish I could leave the hotel asap but I had to pray before leaving cos I was catching a bus to leave the city. The guy at front office said the water was turned off cos of maintenance. I don't know if it was true, but I was too angry to confront more. And besides when I wanted to check in early the day before, the girl at front office asked for 50thousands rup. Which I gave cos I just want to rest quickly, but I didn't get charged for anything before for early check in at bobobox. But with this kind of experience I wish I chose to leave and change hotel.

3. Wifi is not bad for just browsing and streaming
4. The hotel keepers/staff are friendly and very helpful

What needs to be improved:
1. Those who order via Agoda should confirm first with the hotel because it is often not recorded in the hotel/OYO system (according to the hotel's statement) so that they are not asked to rebook. Yesterday I had a problem but I contacted Agoda's CS to confirm with the central OYO.
2. Only 1 towel is given for each room
3. The toilet does not have a sink, mirror and trash can. Also there is no exhaust fan so it takes a long time to dry

I ordered via REDDOORZ, and it was paid off. It turned out that when we arrived at the hotel at 10pm, our group didn't get a room. He said the application was wrong. Over booking.

Surprisingly, even though they already knew about the overbooking and said they had confirmed it to the application (since morning but REDDOORZ didn't pick up and didn't reply), they didn't contact us about this problem.

And when we didn't they just said there were no rooms and they would look for a room at another hotel.

It turned out that at the same time there were more than 4 groups that I know experienced the same thing and at 8 pm they didn't get a room either.

End of all the rage. After the new rampage quickly work.

But... The restaurant was good, although it is small. We may see the ceiling of top floor right from the ground floor, which may provide cozy feeling.
The service was average. But particularly I have to mention that this hotel could not provide wake up call service properly. In a day they may come to your room and knock the door.

Vico was absolutely right that it was worth the trip! 100% recommend. We also booked a guide, he helped us get down the waterfall, pointed us to some nice spots and the best of all he took some amazing pictures and videos of us!

The Bromo tour was also great. We booked the private tour so we could enjoy everything in our own pace. Sadly there were too many clouds to see the sunrise, but it was still very beautiful and we loved to walk around the crater!

The homestay is great, Vico picked us up from the trainstation, helped us book a bus to Bali and even dropped us off at the busstop. Vico‚Äôs wife cooked the best and tastiest food for us no matter what time of the day. If you decided you were hungry, she was always happy to cook the most delicious meal.

The rooms are poor and need a complete overhaul. No soap or shampoo is provided and the bathrooms are dirty and need to be upgraded considerably.

Breakfast is even worst unless you prefer poor quality Indonesian food. No bread, cereal or milk is provided and they just shrug shoulders if asked with no care in the world. No egg dishes or yoghurt or sweets are provided as well.

I actually had to do a BYO and brought in my own milk, butter, bread and continent for breakfast.

Unless you prefer poor quality rooms and poor quality food then I suggest you stay away from this place. Spend a few extra dollars and find another hotel. God knows why people are giving 5 star reviews?

Bahasa

Jangan repot-repot memesan hotel ini terutama jika Anda orang asing.  Kamarnya buruk dan perlu perbaikan total.  Tidak ada sabun atau sampo yang disediakan dan kamar mandinya kotor dan perlu ditingkatkan.

Sarapan bahkan lebih buruk kecuali Anda lebih suka makanan Indonesia berkualitas buruk.  Tidak ada roti, sereal, atau susu yang disediakan dan mereka seharusnya hanya mengangkat bahu jika ditanya tanpa peduli di dunia.  Tidak ada hidangan telur atau yogurt atau permen yang disediakan juga.

Kecuali jika Anda lebih suka kamar berkualitas rendah dan makanan berkualitas buruk maka saya sarankan Anda menjauh dari tempat ini.  Habiskan beberapa dolar ekstra dan temukan hotel lain.",4598

It turned out that until evening there were still people gathering in the living room, and the room was not soundproof so it sounded very noisy. Finally, the room upgrade moved upstairs, it turned out that the conditions were worse. The bathroom was very dirty, lots of black crust at the end of the bathroom floor and behind the toilet. The shower cubicle is equally dirty. We experienced this condition in the 2 rooms that we booked, so we felt uncomfortable and decided to check out the next morning. Luckily the staff are friendly and helpful. The inn is also willing to pay the remaining money that we have paid, we are only charged for staying 1 night.

we were very disappointed, the service was not friendly, the floor of the room was so dirty that I borrowed a broom to clean the room myself, there was no room service with the reason that in the past there was often loss of belongings to the occupants of the room that stayed, the drain in the bathroom was clogged, breakfast ""thumb down"" so we chose to look for breakfast outside,

ehh.. when we wanted to check out we were not given the opportunity to shower and pray, THE HOTEL SERVANT AT THE RECEPTIONIST said ""NOT MORE THAN 12.00 TO CHECK OUT""

Let me tell you 2 good things about this place: 1. Location 2. Big rooms
Unfortunately, that was all.

My first impression is that the place was....dark. I mean, I've been to some syariah-based places in town, be it hotel, guest house, etc and all of them were bright and cheerful. This one wasn't, and I thought ""ah, no problem maybe it is just the FO"" but I was totally wrong because the corridors and room light was also dim.

Then, I was glad for a moment when we entered the big room, until my husband noticed that the bedsheet, curtain, and almost all of the furnitures were..... dirty. I mean, very dusty and seems like no one has ever stayed in that room before us (and no one has ever cleaned the room).
The furnitures looked like new, though.
Next was when we checked the water and it worked well until we noticed that smell... yes. The water was stinky.
And there were no STANDARD toiletries such as toothbrush.

Ok. It was unpleasant but we're still hoping for the breakfast in the next morning. Yay, breakfast time! It was around 8 when we went downstairs to grab ours and all we got was in my picture. Cold. And water. End.
There were some families who went down for their breakfast after us and their faces were not less disappointed as ours.

With almost the same rate I can get a much better hotel in town.

I hope that the other guests don't have any experiences like we did.

P.s.
*We are a young couple and we weren't asked to show marriage certificate or anything else besides on my husband's KTP (his KTP is still not changed and relationship status is still written: single). I am of course thankful but as a place with syariah concept I was hoping them to at least ask for marriage certificate. LOL.

NOT RECOMMENDED
As soon as I entered the building there was a stench of smoke from the attached ovallounge which wasn't a welcoming smell for an alleged 4 star hotel. Check in was quick but they put our bags on a bell trolley...but there was no one to bring them to the room.
The room had a musty smell, the sheets were old and greying. At breakfast, all the hot food was left open so it was cold, lots of things were empty and not replenished (it was 9am in a breakfast served until 11am). Cheese was all soft and sweaty where it had been out for too long and the breakfast room was generally too hot.
Back at the room, I put the privacy sign and went back to sleep having only arrived at the hotel at 2.15am...and then got a phone call to ask what time they could clean the room.
Overall, I decided to spend money on a different hotel for the remaining 3 nights of a planned and prepaid 4-night stay in the hope of the hotel not ruining the trip. Disappointing and obviously a waste of money.

4335,ChIJp3AIDdsxMTARBUgM1sKuCpU,Radisson Medan,Daniel Tarigan,5,"Detailed Review about Radisson Medan:

Do not book the Suite Room. It is just a lot bigger bu a lot worse then Superior Rom.

From the very beginning you enter the property, you will feel a bit confuse with the very high rating of this hotel. The building looks old and the lobby area seems to be not bright at all. I think they need to improve the comfort of the lobby area. Especially in the evening you will hear a loud music from bar/lounge next to the lobby.

But the outstanding service from the front desk staffs change it all. The staff offered me to check in earlier as I arrived 2 hours before check in time. When I had bad time because of loud sound from the outside due to new years parade, they offered me to change my room.

Even when the Housekeeping forgot to clean my room until I found it late at night, the front desk staff apologize very politely and ask the Housekeeping staff to make up my room. And when it took very long, the staff come to me and ask me to change room and give me complementary breakfast for the next day.

The next day the Housekeeping Supervisor came to visit my room and apologize again and make sure my room is cleaned up on time. They take this thing very seriously and keep reminding me that they are there to help me. This is a very nice human touch you can't get in most hotel especially in Medan.

We stayed for a week in this hotel. The first night was in Suite. The room is not that surprising. A lot scratches on the floor. The only good things about Suite is the size of the room and the bath tub which wasn't working well as the water kept going down the sewage even if you have closed the disposal pipe.

But all changed when we stayed the next day in Superior Room. The room has been renovated with combination of parquet and marble floor. The bed is super comfy and the bathroom amenities are complete and have a very high quality.

The room is spacious and the shower works very well all the time. They have space to store towel next to the shower room so you don't have to get your bathroom all wet just to get towel. Ironing board, high power hair dryer and water boiler is ready in the room.

The room designed is very functional yet luxurious. This is a real 4 star hotel. Whenever I have to stay in Medan, this hotel should be in my top list.",1191

the second, I extended the room, and they said my room had been sold and I had to move to another room, seriously I was very shocked and disappointed, at that time there were still other rooms and why weren't other guests given rooms that were still AVAILABLE  !!!
their reasons didn't make sense and I complained for quite a while and in the end they didn't replace my room but my feelings were a little disappointed already ! then they no say ‚Äú SORRY ‚Äú about that.
i stay in this hotel not for FREE , please !
so please give the best service.
but btw only the receptionists named ""Rudy and Bella"" were friendly.
although the receptionist service is very BAD, I like the cleanliness of the rooms at this hotel, and the friendly security.
please this company is looking for a receptionist who has potential and can find a solution, not just talk and think the problem is so easy without thinking about other people's feelings !",2849

About 11pm, we made a last minute booking through Agoda for the next day, however once the payment was finalised, there was an error and the booking showed it was for the very same night. Within minutes we notified the hotel via the number in their website and via whatsapp regarding the error and requested them to amend the the booking for the next day.  Agoda representative also confirmed that they had notified the hotel requesting for the change.  In addition, we also personally emailed the hotel for the same.  The next morning at 7am, their front desk agent sent an email refusing to update the booking and blatantly asking us to make a completely new booking directly with them (no refund for the previous booking). A request for escalation, was followed by another email from their front desk manager stating the same thing that they would not honor the request for updating the booking.
We were shocked with such a poor and shortsighted business decision displayed by the hotel. It was very obvious that it was a genuine mistake where we made the booking at 11pm, and it would be leas likely we would checkin so late and within minutes we attempted to notify them.  Such decision and approach reflect extremely poor and shortsighted business acumen, showing greediness and serious lack of understanding of what customer service and the service industry are all about.
Our family and relatives have been supporting this hotel for many many years and such experience left a very bitter taste and we would rather spend our money somewhere else from now onwards.",4991

- Soft Bed
- No carpets in the room
- I can hear everything from the room next to me, even their alarm in the morning üòÇ (no proper sound isolation)
- The room's A/C temperature control switch was not working.
- If you go to breakfast buffet after 8:30 am, probably you will not find a table to sit. And even if you did find a table to sit the queue for food is high.
- Their gym happens to be only functioning from 7 am to 10 am (same time like breakfast buffet time üòÇ) and they start to open again around 5 pm to 8 pm. So if you are keen to workout in a flexible schedule, good luck with that üòÄ.

about $40 Aud a night for the cheapest room on agoda.
The rooms are very large.
They have a fridge.
Staff were friendly.
Deposit for staying is only 300k rupiah.
Pool is great, gets lots of sun (warm), showers available and there is a toddler pool with a slide next to the adult one.
Live piano player in the lobby/ restaurant
One of very few hotels at this price with a bathtub
Good location close to the malls and hospitals

Cons:
The hotel is old and it shows.
Smokers seem to ignore the hotel rules about which floors you can smoke on (we had to move floors to avoid smokers)
No wheelchair access so prams have to be carried up the stairs.

Located near many places that are suitable for both tourists and returning residents alike including local street foods and also high end cafes. Good and clean rooms and very friendly service and staff as well. Recommended :),3738
4614,ChIJG1Dc960xMTARtUPpY1oCKWo,Gandhi Inn,Suwandy,5,"This is my first time we're here. Actually we booked standard room but the customer service suggest we upgrade the room when we check in because I bring my little son too. Just add around USD 4 or IDR 60K we get bigger than standard room. Don't forget you have to deposit USD 10 (IDR 150K) and you'll get it after check-out.

In the room, we get 3 pillows, hot water (shower) in bathroom, 2 bottle aqua, 2 slippers and free wi-fi (but my little son said the bandwidth is really not wide). You can get additional water from dispenser out of room or in lobby.
Unfortunately the air conditioner in the room not too cold, I think the lobby colder than the room but it's okay for us. Oh yeah, if you're smokers, you have to ask them where the good area for smoke

The second point, we cannot watch the television because the receiver cannot turn on by remote or manually. Because we not always in the room so we no need to complain. And the other curtain not worked well.
We can rest well because the inn very quiet in the midnight.

In the morning, we have free breakfast from the inn. You can eat bread (or toast), porridge, green bean porridge, fried rice (not too nice for us), fried vermicelli, egg foo young, boiled noodles and some fruit. The additional, you can drink tea, coffee, milk and water too.

I think the inn maybe have around 4 parking area slot, so may be you have parked your car in road side if the parking area was full.
We just seldom see the other waiters except the security, customer service, and 2 or 3 waiters in restaurant.

I think this inn recommended for everyone, unfortunately there is no family room. my suggestion for the inn, the waiters must check the room when there are guest check-out.",4656

Apartment-style hotel offering a variety of sized apartment suites for short or longer-term rentals.  Apartments are furnished with AC in each bedroom as well as in the common areas, and are equipped with a basic kitchen (small refrigerator, gas stove-top, water service) and very basic cooking needs (one pan, one pot, flatware, etc.).  Ideal for a family that can benefit from cooking some of their meals.  Comfortable for Westerners who are not yet used to the intense heat and humidity of the tropics.

There is a small pool and a restaurant.  Breakfast buffet is available.  Restaurant food was precisely that - restaurant food.  There are good options for restaurants within walking distance if you desire something better than room service.  There is also a small exercise room with some older weight machines, free weights, treadmills and stair machines, all in various shades of repair and disrepair.  No AC in this room so it gets pretty sweaty pretty quickly!

Even though previously I had agreed with the receiption to enter tomorrow. So they can prepare it. While I was waiting for them to chat behind me via chat (very impolite) they finally said comfortably. Electricity in some of these units has not been installed. Is it possible that a big hotel like this doesn't have electricity installed? He thinks people don't understand, that type of corrupt hotel employee! Hopefully management sans hotel can consider what I experienced. Employees like that are like a thorn in the flesh, hurting the hotel management's image!",1952

4869,ChIJfdnxdlK51C8RMmV3jZodZjc,Ocean Beach Hotel,Roby Iskandar,3,"Stayed here on early July 2022 for one night.
I actually wanted to stay for at least two nights, but the hotel was full booked.

This hotel was perfectly placed I must say. It's right in front of Padang beach. And its room rate is below other hotels that is located in similar position.

Lobby was spacious, looked nice, like a proper 4 star hotels. Receptionists were kind. Just a little note on how they were so casually interact with each other while serving guests.

For the room, I booked the cheapest one, which is rated around IDR 650k before special discount. a no view room, breakfast included. It was spacious beyond my expectations. It also has luxurious vibes, and unlike lots of hotel rooms which has deemed light, it was BRIGHT, met my personal preferences.

The bathroom was clean and looked nice as well. One note is that it was a bit smelly. Smelled like someone didn't flush after urinated at some place. That smell came and gone while I stayed.

Bed and linen felt nice, can instantly fell asleep. But I noticed some stains here and there at the linen. Unfortunately.

The VIEW from Ocean Lounge (if I not mistaken) is exceptional. See it yourself in the pics. You can enjoy the view and sound of the sea for hours here. Has small swimming pool as well.

Advantage +

- strategic, near andalas plaza and the beaches
- The prize is quite cheap among another hotel

Weakness

- No bath towel
- No hot water
- the bed is so poor
- No wifi
- TV is so old, still using tube model but the program still ok
- the lamp and the wall is so old
- The door quite old
- What the most I hated is the toilet bowl, I don't know is kind of toilet bowl like they have. The bowl is in on the front instead like the regular toilet bowl where the bowl is on the behind. I don't know how to do defecate in it.

I stay it for one night, the photos on the app is so good but when you came it feel tricked you.

The dorm room is mixed gender, no curtains. Shared bathroom with cold water shower. However, I agree with Javier's comment that they might care more for the money than serving the customers. After I paid for my room in full and checked in, a few hours later another staff shift told me that I needed to pay 15% extra for the public holiday price. Really annoyed me since everything is paid for and it was because their staff charged me the 'normal' rates but not 'holiday hyped rates''. It was not even a lot of money, just 2 dollars, looked like something a generous host would easily absorb provided the mistake was on their part. So I refused to pay more but this kinda ruined the whole experience staying here. Love the roof top balcony though.",5075

We checked out right after the first night by even paying extra charge, which I find it very offending and stupid. The bed sheet is so dirty and disgusting with cockroach feasts, the toilet paper was not there, the toilet bowl was NOT even washed and makes us want to vomit.

Staffs are not even in uniform and smoking all the time, it was so noisy, and to top it all up, the place was not even along the main road, it was in some dark, very deserted small lane.

There were spider webs everywhere and lamps and lights are not working at all. Wire cables are all over the place and it was very dangerous for someone to get tripped over. Breakfast was two slices of burnt bread which was absolutely uneatable.

Trust me, the price of S$40 was a total rip off, I wouldn't even pay a single dollar a night for this kind of place. We couldn't stay another night at all and checked out after the first night, yet still have to pay an extra one night charge. Unbelievably disappointed.

This guest house is suitable for families because it is very affordable. Overall, we would like to stay here again, hopefully Baba Guest House will maintain its excellent service and improve the condition of the rooms we mentioned earlier. Good luck for the future.",5478

Because this hotel is still new, it feels like staying in a 5-star hotel, clean, tidy, comfortable and smells good.
The service of all the staff is very friendly, sir/sir, a good security guard doesn't need to be asked to immediately bring down our family's luggage, which is super a lot and complicated, if we want to go out, the security will immediately help us carry things into the car.
Ma'am and mas, the receptionist day and night are all friendly, especially Ms. Salma, who is very friendly, explaining this and that, thank you, Ms. Salma, for satisfying service.
Mas, the housekeepers here are also really friendly, sorry, bro, as long as our family stays here, we bother, like when we ask to clean the room.
This hotel is on the 1st floor there is a swimming pool for 24 hour swimming it seems, there is no closing time limit as far as I know, the 2nd floor has a fitness room, the 3rd floor has a restaurant. Here every corner of the hotel is super aesthetic and instagramable, spacious comfortable rooms are suitable for those who bring toddlers who are more active and can really run.
Now for those who are looking for a hotel that really has to have an elevator because it's lazy to go up and down stairs, access to this hotel is easy, there are elevators and stairs, this hotel is also very safe, as far as I know, only staff and guests who actually stay at this hotel can access it. because every time you want to go up the floor you have to tap tap using the keylock given by the receptionist without the keylock you can't go up either to access the elevator or the stairs.
Hopefully my super lengthy review can help colleagues who want to travel and look for hotels around the city of Solo, I recommend this hotel cheap, comfortable and easy to reach.

5419,ChIJ3bROv5MXei4R9MdYW8gMR4s,Petit Boutique hotel,Putu Chris Susanto,4,"4.5 stars. Some of the pros: It is strategically located, with a lively night market a stone's throw away. They validate your parking, if you bring your or own vehicle. The room is clean, the cleaning team is very efficient and swift. The front desk is very efficient, and the security team is very polite. The historic theme is definitely a selling point, tho some of the choices of decor is questionable (tho not too gaudy).
Some cons: As the name implies, the room is petite... It is very tiny. I think the room (including the tiny bathroom) is only 2.5 x 3.5 m. It is as tight as last year's skinny jeans. Lol. But if you've paid 80+ USD for tiny rooms in Singapore or Paris, this is comparable in size but less pricey. That's something that they cannot change easily. The breakfast was boxed (nof buffet) and it wasn't that good. My second day bfast was so salty, it was barely edible. Also, the front desk staff (whilst efficient) could be more lively and smiley. Those things can be improved, IMO.",3812

Hotel staff offer smoking room with treatment (not sure what that is), or downgrade from 24m2 room to 20m2 room. When we reached the smoking level/floor (Our assumption: where all the smoking rooms are), right after the elevator, the smell was unbearable, hence we decided to go for the downgrade option.  We have asked for an upgrade but the staff mentioned that only smoking rooms are available at the moment. The staff mentioned that preference for non-smoking rooms can only be fulfilled based on availability. Smoking vs non smoking rooms is not something we (as non smoking guests) can easily accept and tolerate, unlike the window view or even the size of the bed. This is our biggest disappointment.

At night, we smelled something from our 20sqm non-smoking room. Not sure if it was cigarettes or something else. And based on our personal opinion, the pillows are too hard while the bed is too soft. Your experience may be different from ours

Soundproofing for our room was not good, noises from other rooms could be heard clearly, and because of the location of the hotel which is directly next to the train station and close to the main road, noise is unavoidable. If you think silence in your room is important, maybe this hotel is not the right choice for you.

And for body soap, only a few drops are left in the bottle. Although we didn't use it but would love to know if it was refilled.

For breakfast, it's normal.  The fruit is not as fresh as we expected.  Chicken sausage, yellow rice and fried rice are too dry.

The car park is quite big (outdoor and basement), although we're sure it won't fit if all guests take their cars. If you park at the hotel, you will be asked to pay around IDR 5K for parking fees for 1 night's stay. This is new for us, usually there is no parking fee for hotel guests.

During our stay the staff were as polite and friendly as we would expect. The restaurant is clean, and well maintained.

However, the hotel's policy regarding non-smoking vs smoking rooms made us decide not to consider this hotel again for our next stay in Solo.",2482

LOBBY. Targeting young people aged 20-35 years, when I saw the color of the logo & photos of the exterior of the building, I had hope that this hotel would have fun, cute interiors and be able to take photos. But as soon as I entered the lobby, it turned out that I had to lower my expectations. The lobby is decorated with purple sofas, a fussball table and a rattan egg chair in another corner. The wall as the background is decorated with color blocks of several colors accompanied by writing in Arial font with words that seem to be spoken in a flat tone ""when in doubt chill out"" and ""my superpower is chill"".

Ok, this is a budget hotel. But hey, I've stayed at hotels with the same rate or even cheaper but the lobby is more attractive. At least there are simple murals and not just playing with color blocks and quotes that are written flat..

ONLY LADDER. This budget hotel does not have an elevator. So, prepare your stamina. Or yes, you can rest first in the lobby before going up to the room. Suitcases are not recommended because there is no elevator or room boy to carry suitcases/bags.

The fitness center was well-equipped, allowing me to maintain my workout routine while on the road. Additionally, the hotel's meeting and conference rooms were spacious and well-appointed, making them perfect for business gatherings.

The location of Hotel Sunan Solo is another standout feature. Situated in the heart of Solo, it offers easy access to the city's attractions, shopping areas, and cultural landmarks. Whether I wanted to explore the vibrant local markets or visit historical sites, everything was within reach, making my stay both convenient and exciting.

Last but not least, the impeccable service at Hotel Sunan Solo deserves special mention.

- Strategic location.
- Places to eat and several touristic places are reachable on a 5-minute walk. At night, across from the hotel, there is a delicious soup/soto, satay, and getuk (traditional Javanese snack) stall.

Cons:
- The rooms are not well maintained; the walls are damp and moldy, and there is no refrigerator.
- The restaurant is too cramped. Limited variety of food for breakfast, and the staff are not all ready yet at breakfast time (egg and kebab stalls). If there are many guests (which happened in our case), there is a possibility of not getting a seat and running out of food.
- The parking lot is limited, and there is a possibility of not getting a place, so you have to park your car on the side of the highway (which also happened during our stay).
- The swimming pool is only for kids with limited facilities.
- The most unpleasant experience: the hotel staff forced their way into our room, where we had already put a ""DO NOT DISTURB"" sign, tidied up (and picked up) our stuff, including our camera and personal things, even though we hadn't checked out yet. I have to confront their front officer (which I actually don't have to do) to solve this unpleasant experience.",750

More attention to the maintenance of the rooms, cleanliness must be improved too, even it is not an issue in the rooms but the public spaces requires constant attention.

Solo food portion is small and on the sweeter or spicier side. What I like about it is that it give you opportunity to try something else since the portion is not for NBA players. We got to try the super duper sweet dessert afterwards.

The service is nice as the people here are soft-spoken and well mannered, the best part of this area. The best part of Indonesians and it should be like this everywhere.

So i gave a review to this place last year, and this year i came back because i have to visit my family nearby. Unfortunately, this place became worse. The bedsheet was gross although i asked them to change it, the second one was also the same. Water heater didn't worked. Water pressure was terrible. Dirty water. Dirty toilet. No lock on the bathroom door. Breakfast was just a piece of fried roll. And if i remember correctly, i booked a more expensive room than last year.ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This was my review on 2019.
The good things are:
Wifi, aircon & hot water works well.
Water pressure on the shower is good.
They only put 1 towel in the room, but you can ask for extra towels to the staff (no charge)
Comfy bed.
There's free mineral water, tea & coffee for 24hours (self service) on the communal space (sitting area). üëç

Suggestions:
Remove the tv on sitting area (which is never turn on & they put cover on it) & add more chairs.

As for the hotel, the place is nice for the price I paid. Definitely worth it. #notcreditingbzzfeed
Of course, if you book a hotel through RD, you would not get any breakfast. But that's fine by me. Instead of eating the standard hotel breakfast, I prefer to look for my breakfast outside and eat like a local.
I used the deluxe room, which make me confused because it doesn't have that much difference compared to the usual standard room. But the room is clean and spacious, even when it looks like a little bit old.
The bathroom is... old. I can't say it's dirty because I know that those stain is caused by the aging instead of dirty. I can't find any hairs on the bathroom floors and even speck of dust above the TV. Maybe they need maintenance or renewal to make it newer and cleaner.
If I were to say their negative sides, it's their shower position that a little bit too high. Then, they did not provide slipper for the guest. Lift also nowhere to be found. And their water pressure... is too weak!

I was intrigued by pictures of the Javanese and colonial architecture and design of the hotel, and was even more surprised how beautiful and very well kept it was when I arrived in person.

Was happy to be escorted to my room with running air condition, and a luxurious bathroom which ran hot water in seconds. Wifi was great, and having cable TV was fun. Couldn't believe what a treat I was in for, especially for the affordable rate I was paying.

Pak Tata and Pak Sugih who were on duty during my stay were very, very accommodating and helpful, informing me of their 22.00 WIB closed gate policy, but leaving me the night guards contact if I was returning or was going to head out late.

I got (the last) standard double room (17m2) room no. 616 with price IDR407K. Little bit overprice... maybe because it is peak season.
I did not (want to) take hotel/ room picture üòÖ

Positive: good location, has sufficient parking space, near to train station, a lot of restaurants nearby. Old Aircond but functioning well. Good water pressure.

Negative: The hotel and room was little bit outdated. The bathroom door can not be closed properly. Bath towel is out dated (but clean), dispenser bath soap was empty, less variety for breakfast and almost empty food with no refill. No water kettle. Need to improve the cleanliness especially the bathroom.

Recommendation:
- Book hotel in advance, especially during peak season to get better hotel with reasoable price.
- Tried the famous ‚ÄúSate Kambing Bu Hj. Bejo‚Äù Loji Wetan Solo. Rate 7/10. Hard satay. Tasteless tongseng. Very crowded (lebaran)
- Tried the famous ‚ÄúGudeg Margoyudan Bu Kasno‚Äù. Not special. Rate 7/10
- Tried Nasi Liwet Bu Sri Pasar Gede Solo. It moved to upstairs in the pasar building. It is not good as I remember in the past üòÖwhen they still located in the street corner (tortoar)
- Tried Warung Tahu Kupat + Telur Sido Mampir. I took the wrong place nearby. I should take the nearby place (with same name, near to traffic light, with additional wording ‚ÄúOriginal‚Äù , in 10m distance)üòÖ

1. The phone administrator is very quick on answering the phone call on the first ring. That's a good impression for guest who seeks for some help. Eventhough the help comes quite late, at least they listen and respond it fast.
2. The receptionists are very friendly, also the staff, they perform a good hospitality towards the guests
3. They have a good public facility that is in line with their hotel theme ""religious"", in which they have many prayer rooms (musholla), I think in every floors. They also have a good kids indoor playground near the lobby. They have a spacious parking area for cars. Wifi is working well
4. They located in strategic position eventhough quite far from the city center, but at least near from several good restaurants and cafe and food street stalls, so it is also easy to order some online foodies.
The negative sides:
1. Honestly if the theme isn't ""religious hotel"" I wouldn't want to stay here because the building is huge but sooooo old. Also I think the building isn't well maintained because there are lots of cracks and damage here and there. Also the furnitures and ambiance is sooo vintage. What made me shocked was, they placed me on a room in 5th floor right in front of pantry room. When I arrived there at evening, the pantry door was opened, that made us could see the inside situation without intention. My mom was shocked because it seemed so creepy and totally mess. My mom initiate to close the door without stopping to pray. We were quite afraid to go outside afterward.
2. The bathroom was soooo old, broken and rusty. When I open the tap water, the first water came out was soo dirty and brown color. The upper shower is also rusty and the ceiling fan sounds sooo loud because it's broken. And the ultimate dissapointment was the toilet was broken, I don't know why the flush can't work properly so my *peeeeepp* came out again from the hole. After trying to open the toilet box and manually flash using dustbin and everything, finally those *peeep* can go inside again after a long struggle. The hotel janitor came after I successfully doing it on my own. OMG that was nightmare.
3. The next morning when we were about to have breakfast in the restaurant, they said that our voucher without breakfast. I was a bit surprised because I ordered from Agoda and I remembered before I click order that the price was included the breackfast that worth xxxx IDR. I know that I only paid a cheap amount (about 380k IDR), but when I realize that I paid that hotel with that quality, without breakfast? oh no I am a bit disappointed again
4. My daughter wanted to swim and we could swim in the Lor-In hotel that still one group with them that was located beside this hotel. We need to take a walk for 5 minutes and paid 25k IDR/each person to enter.
All in all, when I visited Solo again, it's better to pay more and get better facilities rather than saving some money but getting a disappointing experience. I give 6/10 for this hotel, hopefully they can improve a lot aspects : cleanness, lighting, facility etc",2189

Unfortunately, when I stayed here last month there was a birthday party celebration at the restaurant that held from around 5 pm to 10.30 pm. The sound check started at around 4 pm. It was loud and no information about it shared to us beforehand. It was loud (of course) and became louder because the restaurant located in the ground floor beside the pool which is an open space. Moreover, the design of the building (the center of the ground floor was the pool and the building/rooms surround it) made the sound to be heard more clearly to our room. The pool itself was closed earlier because of it. I don't know why it was held at night in the open space restaurant while most people staying at hotel are to rest. Fortunately, I was going out at 7 pm and came back at 9.30 pm. So, I didn't experience how loud it was because even at 10 pm the party was still going on and obviously disturbing.

However, the hotel is clean and the breakfast menu is varied. There are a lot of good collections displayed such as motorbikes and Keris.

Highly recommended the hotel, because they do really take care you! Not only the hotel experience, but extra miles!

When we leave the hotel, she even come to me and ask me to be careful (hati-hati). Such a sweet lady!",5493

My bf booked the room from Agoda, he gave me the booking id to check in. I gave the receptionist that Id. He asked me for the name of booking. And he said that there's no booking number under that name. He asked for the pdf file, my bf didn't gave me the pdf file cause usually we can just check in using the booking id. Like literally after i check out from this Hotel, i moved to another hotel, i was able to check in using only the booking id. LOL.

I took a trip starting from 6am arrived in that hotel at 8pm cause all of the delayed. Hoping i get smooth check in. And the receptionist was really NOT HELPING AT ALL. HE JUST DIDN'T CARE TO HELP. IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IN HERE JUST REMEMBER SHOW THEM THE PDF FILE, cause clearly he can't confirm the booking just by using booking id lol. What's the point of that booking id. I even had a little bit argument with the receptionist. He assured me that there's no booking under that id. After an hour my bf landed from his flight and gave me the pdf, i went back to this hotel and gave him the pdf he asked. Just like that, he then confirm my booking üòí Dude, my advice is just don't do online booking then if it's that complicated for you to confirm your customer online booking. We paid for that booking dude.

Thank you. Not gonna book room from this hotel again. Not gonna recommend it to my peers.",1832

The hotel is also within walking distance of Yogyakarta's main attractions, such as the Kraton Palace and Taman Sari Water Castle.

The rooms at Hotel Neo Malioboro were clean, modern, and comfortable. I appreciated the attention to detail, such as the complimentary bottled water and coffee and tea making facilities. The rooms were also equipped with flat-screen TVs and free Wi-Fi, which was a nice touch.

One of the standout features of Hotel Neo Malioboro was its rooftop swimming pool. The pool offered stunning views of the city and was a great place to relax after a long day of exploring. The hotel also had a fitness center and spa, which were both well-maintained and offered a range of services.

Now the things I didn't like so much about this hotel: The rooms just are average, you can hear every sound from other rooms, the airco was making a lot of noise and leaking water on the floor. They also charge 10k for water refills, i have been to more than 100 hotels so far and this was never an issue.

So, we entered the room, and it was... average, but it wasn't okay because it was pricey for a three-star hotel. Maybe it was the location, but it was still overpriced.

And the most disappointing part is... we couldn't request for a late-checkout, even 30 minutes--they said because the room is full.

I love everything about my room, the service, the assistance they provided for us. Room was spacious and clean. I also love the spacious bathroom.

The ambiance was peaceful and we had great rest here. We also can work peacefully and do our work around the homestay.  People are allowed to bring their small pets, so I'd get to meet some cute dogs during my stay.

The pantry was nice, they always have water for us to get. We can also cook for ourselves if we wanted to. I just can't wait to come back.   Great experience.

Firstly the hotel was located in a small dingy alley, but I was hoping on entering the hotel it would be a gem in the rough. Unfortunately even inside the hotel, it was kind of not very clean surroundings (it wasn't particularly dirty just run down). Thankfully one of the staff helped me with the suitcase to bring above. The room itself was very small too, as was the bathroom. There was no seperation between toilet and shower. One of the positives was I was able to get a scooter for the day from front desk itself (who did take my passport). There aren't many tourism facilities nearby to book travels/ rent like Bali, so this is the best bet.

I guess for the price, I shouldn't be expecting much better but I paid here more than resorts in Bali in amazing locations. On the whole, I would even inch towards recommending to skip the city of Yogyakarta altogether as Borobudur is closed to go up.",4480

I berated him, afraid and shocked. We were two ladies staying at the room, he could have opened the door while we‚Äôre undressed. The inn touted as shariah inn but I found this mistake horrifying and felt very very vulnerable and unsafe because of this incident.
I complained both to front desk and room service and got only placating apology that did nothing to the shock and fear I experienced. We feel unsafe as women staying there on our own.
Such a shame cause we liked the room, it‚Äôs spacious and clean and the shower was working well.

- There is no information about the wifi password on each room.
- The fan is set way too straight, it needs to be lowered so the wind can reach the bed

- The electricity socket should be placed lower so guest can use phone while still charging.
- The toilet flusher is not working properly and it feels slimy when we touch it
- The bathroom smells piss
- There is only shower inside and it is not removable so it's a little difficult if we want to take a bath without washing our hair. We also have to brush tooth and wash face separately outside in the sink.

Pros:
- Strategic location
- Parking lot
- Roof top
- Comfortable Bed
- Hot water
- Breakfast (standard fried rice)
- Drinking water refill station
- Relatively cheap for dorm-style 'hotel'.
- 4-6 person each room.

Cons:
- Not so clean
- Rusty, Musty, as this hotel has been neglected for quite a while
- Private bathroom is quite weird. Exhausts don't seem to be effective. A bit dirty
- Bed room wall is dirty
- Very noisy sounds from Air con machine outside our room
- TV seems to be broken
- Electric receptacles are far away from bed
- NO WIFI (Wi-fi only available in lobby area)
- No additional lamp for bed below
- Provided towels are a bit small
- Roof top or restaurant area is not well maintained
- What used to be swimming pool, currently used as pond. Yes, a pond. With gold fishes.

We are a 40-ish couple from Australia and stayed in a double room with private bathroom (hot shower). Irfan offered us an amazing price for the month of Ramadan, and then we came back for a few more nights after a trip away (we could store our things here for free!) for another good price. We would not hesitate to book again. It‚Äôs like a second home.

The guesthouse is interesting and beautiful, filled with wooden antiques and an indoor fishpond that sounds tranquil at night.
The 4 private rooms (and 1 dorm room) are huge and clean (thanks Yuli you lovely woman).
The rooms all have a desk and a lamp.
It‚Äôs reasonably quiet.
There is free drinking water, tea & coffee & toast, and price includes an Indonesian breakfast.
The TV in the sitting room has Netflix.
The internet is fast.
It‚Äôs in an amazing location (2 min walk to the famous Prawirotaman Street straight ahead, or go left out the door and you‚Äôre in a friendly village kampung you must wander through).
The kitchen has a fridge (do not forget to label your food) and it is fully equipped for cooking (there‚Äôs an indoor traditional market very close, and Superindo 10 mins walk- definitely try your hand at cooking).
It‚Äôs an older building and some things could use improving or updating, but for this price you won‚Äôt get any better.

Most of all, Irfan is a legend and can give you advice on anything (especially traditional arts and culture: where to buy quality batik, where to eat the best local food, how to see excellent gamelan). He can arrange or advise on transport, tours, bike hire, travel, festivals/exhibitions, nature excursions, phone/SIM, etc‚Ä¶ But he won‚Äôt be in your face about it (which is great- he doesn‚Äôt do that annoying hard-sell). So do not hesitate to ask him anything, he will go out of his way to help you. And let him know if you have any problems with your room so he can fix it.

Honestly I‚Äôd like to keep this place a secret, but it deserves all the business it can get. You won‚Äôt regret booking here.

Ps: some unique tips for the area (google maps is your friend): Just Playon is a cafe/bar with a POOL. We also liked Yamalu coffee, Seafood & Pecel Lele Pak Tino, SUBstore bar, the art galleries Tirtodipuran LINK and Cemeti, all the street art, wandering the kampungs, Sekar Pizza, Tempo Gelato, Dropshot coffee (and the little craft, record and secondhand stores in the same block), jazz on a Sunday eve at Via Via (just get a drink or a snack though, food is average).",3514

Overall it is visually attractive but there quite a few minor problems that disturbs my stay here. Maybe its because i got the farthest room in the back.

( - ) Broken bathroom handle in the room.
( - ) Toilet flush only gives small amount of water to flush.
( - ) The room and bathroom is quite damp at first so need time to clear the air inside.
( - ) Broken glass lamp cover near the bed, covered with tapes.
( ! ) Lights went down multiple times with only small generator to deal with. But after checking outside the lights in the whole neighborhood is out.
( - ) No restaurant inside, but quite far from other food places. There are tables and minibar but no activity.

If you haven't been here, walk inside near the stores to make sure you don't pass the entrance, as its entrance is quite small but pretty noticeable, especially when the street was packed with people walking around at weekend.

The staff were very nice even for the first timer who haven't been at Bobobox. The direction and policy explained was very clear. But a little bit slow on response while on the chat at the app but it's understandable.

Their app was very useful and important part of your stay so try to install the app before entering.

The pod was quite satisfying, but the site map may confusing, as the direction and the location of communes (prayer room, rooftop space) wasn't specifically tells at which floor.

There were some kitchen too with microwave and sink available for use. Every floor has a water dispenser so it's best for you to bring your own bottle/tumbler.

The pod itself is very comfort. The app can be utilized to control the lamp and many other things.

The room itself is cozy and clean. Got a pretty good view as well. A bit of a drawback is the lighting of the room, which makes an excellent ambience to relax but too dim to be use as a working space.

6487,ChIJkaPNMjJYei4R3ci1mdlX780,Kimaya Sudirman Yogyakarta by Harris,DIVYESH WADKE,4,"We stayed here for 4 nights. Our stay was very pleasant. Staff is very courteous. The accessibility to nearby regions is of great value. They have multiple in hotel services like swimming pool and spa. It is an ideal place to stay for couples and families while in Yogyakarta.

2 downsides:
1. Swimming pool is available only from 8 am to 6 pm, which is weird. No guest is going to stay in hotel during the day to enjoy swimming pool instead of going out at a tourist destination. So the swimming pool is kind of useless.
2. They do not help to arrange any tours to surrounding places or help get any local tour agency number.",1147
