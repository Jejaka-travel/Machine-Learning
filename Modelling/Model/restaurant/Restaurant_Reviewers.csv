20,ChIJ8yJa_OMXei4Ri0duyVd8hgc,Babi Guling Bli Kadek,Vicky Delani,5,"A must visit if you go to Solo. A very generous amount of meat with very reasonable price. The taste is so delicious, in fact in my experience this is better than a famous nasi bigul i ate in Bali a few years ago. The place is quite small but all is well since the food is excellent and the service is very friendly."
21,ChIJ8yJa_OMXei4Ri0duyVd8hgc,Babi Guling Bli Kadek,Luna House Yogyakarta,5,"This is our lunch when we were in Solo in 2 days.
Authentic Bali.
Original taste.
Very recommended.
All the family members did the jobs partially.
Proud of you."
22,ChIJ8yJa_OMXei4Ri0duyVd8hgc,Babi Guling Bli Kadek,Andre Bastary,5,"When you wanted the Bali experience in Solo, the food not the hotels, then you gotta go to Waroeng Bli Kadek. The pork meat is extremely juicy, soft and just the right amount of jus in it. The crispy suckling pig skin is very crunchy. The plecing satay is a mixed meat & fat satay, it‚Äôs tasty as long as you don‚Äôt mind eating the fat. The only complaint I have is their spiciness level is too damn high for my taste.

This place is not too bad at all, great balance of Balinese taste, in comparison to Bali‚Äôs best suckling pig waroengs such as Pak Malen or Karya Rebo. Wonderful addition to my list of Solo delicacies."
23,ChIJ8yJa_OMXei4Ri0duyVd8hgc,Babi Guling Bli Kadek,Lidwina Arin,5,"Calling all non-halal (pork) foodies! If you visit Solo, don't forget to try this babi guling restaurant. Even for delivery service, the quality of the food doesn't change. The portion is big, with an affordable price. I think this babi guling taste is really authentic, similar with any other babi guling restaurants in Bali."
24,ChIJ8yJa_OMXei4Ri0duyVd8hgc,Babi Guling Bli Kadek,Nathan Anugerah Setiawan,5,The most delicious pig cuisine I have tasted in Solo. The 'Nasi Babi Spesial' (Rice with Complete Pig Sidedish) was so delicious. The flavour was on point and so felt legit. The 'Babi Suwir Sambal Matah' or Pig with Hot Sauce was so good. The 'uritan' and 'Kulit'(Pig Skin) were also delicious. This place really served good food and this is so cheap in my opinion. This is so worth it and I will be back for sure. So delicious and budget friendly. One of the Best for me.

The Ice Shop with mas Agung used to be on the sidewalk of the Jurug area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe campground, in front of the hero's grave. It was very crowded. After there was a culinary center here, they moved too. Ice Degan is different from the others. It tastes better and fresher. Not expensive."

46,ChIJf6nY3CAUei4RkIVfHHbTHZs,Pondok Jowi,hendro mulyo,4,No issues with taste or price. The slight problem is portion. Too little for the rice portion. I ordered nasi bakar bebek. The taste is good. But bebek meat is too hard to chew. Overall is good thou

The atmosphere was amazing and facilities clean and well kept. The service at Un‚Äôs was amazing, all the members of staff were quick, efficient and so kind. Now the best part was the food, the garlic bread was crunchy and delicious as well as the spring rolls. Both steaks were cooked to perfection and were so juicy and tender. The king prawns on the surf and turf were so soft the practically melted in your mouth. A big thank you to Ketut our waiter and all the other staff, we will be back soon."

Was busy however no long wait for drinks or food.
Food was next level with amazing presentation and taste.
Warm fresh Popcorn was served as we were seated.
My husband and I ordered 4 dishes and shared. Lot of food and well priced per dish.
As we were finalizing our bill I was given a long stem rose by Tara. Such a nice touch. Made my night! Will be back again without a doubt!"
81,ChIJvdB3_GpH0i0RlaTq17KvbR0,Barbacoa,Marty C,5,"Updated menu for a Seminyak classic. This has always been a good restaurant, but since reopening their new head chef has really upped the ante and made it exceptional. Tried a number of cocktails all of which were amazing. Everything on the good menu was REALLY good, but the real stand outs were the vegetable sides. The Al Pastor cauliflower was absolutely mind blowing and up there with one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. The carrots as well were incredible. Super friendly and efficient service, despite being their busiest night since reopening. Keep up the good work! Can't wait to come back again."
82,ChIJvdB3_GpH0i0RlaTq17KvbR0,Barbacoa,steven liu,5,I had an unforgettable experience at Barbacoa in 2019 and it is the first restaurant on my list when I returned to Bali after 4 long years. The food was great and wood fired to perfection. I would highly recommend the beef and chicken. The scallop was equally impressive. The grilled pineapple was so good that I ordered a 2nd serving. Overall a lovely experience fueled by excellent food and impeccable services.
83,ChIJvdB3_GpH0i0RlaTq17KvbR0,Barbacoa,Kenneth Tan,3,"We had their bestseller, pork asado and it was nothing to shout about. The pork had a distinct 'porky' taste and it wasn't that great. The veggie dishes were better and we liked the grilled cauliflower. Papuan oysters had some strange toppings that covered the taste of the oysters.

Love the atmosphere but if you are here for the food you'd be disappointed."
84,ChIJvdB3_GpH0i0RlaTq17KvbR0,Barbacoa,Stephanie Rose,4,"Barbacoa is a popular Latin American restaurant with a kitchen fuelled by fire, burning embers, charcoal and smoke. Although the cuisine is quite meat heavy, they also have plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. They have the biggest cocktail list I‚Äôve seen in a while, with every Margarita concoction you can think of. I went with the Lemon Meringue which was a dead ringer for the dessert, meringue and all.

The Rib Fillet Steak with roasted chicken butter was incredible! We did ask for it Medium and received it Rare but it was still delicious. I would also recommend the Mixed Leaf Salad and the Spanish Style Potatoes. The corn was too dry and the Straciatella with tomatoes was OK. The table next to us ordered the  Charcoal Chicken and it smelled so good, we had massive FOMO. Will definitely return here again."
85,ChIJvdB3_GpH0i0RlaTq17KvbR0,Barbacoa,Ying Wah Chan,4,"Decent food and nice setting for a night out. We had a good dinner hangout. Liked it but won't come back. I can't say any dish was outstanding or memorable - one pork dish oddly tasted like chicken even, and desserts were not good. For that price point, there are better restaurants in Bali."
86,ChIJAXhicxJH0i0RLNdqBd88iSk,Bambu Bali - Seminyak,Rei Tan,5,"Amazing place, my favourite restaurant in Bali, one that I make sure to put a reservation in for days before I fly. The ambience is classy and tranquil, and the service staff are friendly and eloquent; we visited with a egregious 9 month old who won't sit still and the wait staff graciously helped to entertain him. The food is delicious, with interesting local spices and elegantly layered. What's more, the prices and portions are reasonable, such that we can order multiple dishes to try. A must visit in Bali for sure."
87,ChIJAXhicxJH0i0RLNdqBd88iSk,Bambu Bali - Seminyak,Eleni Reviews (EleniReviews),5,"We had an amazing fine dining experience here. Our waiter was exceptional and very attentive, the food was so so good and the atmosphere was serene. We enjoyed every single dish we had.

The price is on the high end for Bali standards, but it was well worth it. We would come back here."
88,ChIJAXhicxJH0i0RLNdqBd88iSk,Bambu Bali - Seminyak,Joanne Tan,5,"So glad we chose this place for our last dinner in Bali! Softshell crab was decent as an appetiser, but the Babi Guling and Ikan Masak Di Bukit (barramundi) really stood out. They were well made, the flavours were delicate and they were not too salty or spicy, everything was just nice. We also got Dadar Gulung (Pandan crepes) as dessert to end the night.

Restaurant environment is spacious and comfortable (no bugs!), it‚Äôs great for long chats, catch-ups or just a relaxing dinner together. Staff were warm in their greetings and overall service."
89,ChIJAXhicxJH0i0RLNdqBd88iSk,Bambu Bali - Seminyak,‰∏äÊµ∑‰∫∫,3,"The food is well prepared, but portions are small. What we did not appreciate was that the waiters were constantly on our back to take away the plates as soon as we made a pause and enjoyed the moment; they put lots of pressure on us to speed up our meal and leave the table for the next customers. This has negatively impacted on our mood.  There are many other good restaurants in this area which are much less commercial. I would not recommend"
90,ChIJAXhicxJH0i0RLNdqBd88iSk,Bambu Bali - Seminyak,Christine Andrews,4,"This place looks lovely, but the food is pretty average considering the setting and price.
The service is good, the setting is beautiful, the food is presented nicely. The flavours however aren't anything to write home about. I had the duck and asked for mild spice, my husband had chicken and medium spice. Both were not spicy at all. Don't be afraid to therefore go medium to hot. Same with the rice crackers and condiments. They tell you the spice levels, the red one isn't that hot, and I'm not a big fan of hot spice.
We had a main meal each, one glass of wine, one cocktail, 2 desserts and it cost us around AU$100 / IDR1 million.
We didn't mind the price but we didn't feel the food was worth it. It was a nice experience and I'm glad we went but I won't bother going back."
91,ChIJ74RaGRNH0i0RIJ83QmJQS9M,Kaum Bali,Anna Lynn,5,"One of my favourite Indonesia restaurants in Bali. The restaurant has great vibe and atmosphere. All the dishes are very delicious and nicely presented. The portion is not very big, so you can try more dishes in one go. Cocktails are good as well. Service is quick and staffs are super friendly. This place has both indoor and outdoor dining areas. We had outdoor seats to enjoy beautiful sunset. Will definitely come back again. Highly recommended."
92,ChIJ74RaGRNH0i0RIJ83QmJQS9M,Kaum Bali,Elena Conte,5,"Very good Indonesian food with a modern touch. Prices are high but the taste, service and space are worth it. Only problem for us was the noise of two big groups in the restaurant (about 10+10 people at the same time). Perhaps a separate space could be reserved for big groups, or their table could be arranged outside, to allow other customers to  enjoy the meal. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend it."
93,ChIJ74RaGRNH0i0RIJ83QmJQS9M,Kaum Bali,Red Barker,4,"I really enjoyed the ambience, decor and menu at Kaum.

Well-trained, great staff. Lovely location overlooking Potato Head and the pool area.

It's very easy to over-order and go a bit crazy, but stick to your guns, start smaller with sharing in mind and keep the dishes coming. Their Fish and Satay are must orders!"
94,ChIJ74RaGRNH0i0RIJ83QmJQS9M,Kaum Bali,Maxine Saw,5,"Beautiful place right by the beach. Delicious food, friendly staff and decent prices! I highly recommend getting the pork satay and the prawn and fish dumplings! The staff were also very sweet and surprised us with a little birthday cake üíú very wonderful experience here and will definitely be coming back!"
95,ChIJ74RaGRNH0i0RIJ83QmJQS9M,Kaum Bali,Chelsea Rivera,5,"Food was amazing (great presentation and tasted great), the staff was very helpful with picking food that would suite our taste especially since half of us could handle spicy food and the other half couldn‚Äôt. Staff was also very friendly and the view was on the balcony was beautiful of the beach and sunset! Food was also good to share amongst a big group to give everyone a chance to try each kind."
96,ChIJceqfUrYj0i0R3AKPH-aEZmM,Warung Umah Bali,Sophie Treloar,5,No review could possibly describe how delicious the food is at Warung Umah. I ate 4 seperate times during my stay close by and every meal was beyond incredible. So fresh and flavoursome. Family owned business. Beautiful garden setting. Very kind staff. My #1 restaurant in Bali :)
97,ChIJceqfUrYj0i0R3AKPH-aEZmM,Warung Umah Bali,Ingrid Putri (Ingrid),5,"Very amazing food, great presentation and friendly staff!! I have been to many restaurants in Bali which serve Balinese dishes but Warung Umah is the best so far! The chef is a Balinese Ibu (local woman) that is why the taste is homey and original. Definitely will come back again xx"
98,ChIJceqfUrYj0i0R3AKPH-aEZmM,Warung Umah Bali,Sergi Mul√†,5,"Very nice Balinese warung, the food is amazing and with very good prices. The place is also located in a beautiful garden. All the food is made by the family grandmother, who is an amazing cook. It is worth to get a bit away from the center to find this amazing places run by local families, were the food is much better and the prices too."
99,ChIJceqfUrYj0i0R3AKPH-aEZmM,Warung Umah Bali,Francesco Pallotta,5,"Outstanding local food and dinner experience. High quality ingredients prepared following traditional recipes. Great attention to details. Delicious, beautiful and very fairly priced. The environment is clean, in a beautiful garden surrounded by the rain forest. Don‚Äôt miss it!"
100,ChIJceqfUrYj0i0R3AKPH-aEZmM,Warung Umah Bali,Derrick Foo,5,"Amazing food, great price, and warm friendly people. Was a bit surprised I was the only customer tonight, but everything was fresh and delicious. Location is a bit hidden, but it was worth the adventure - a hidden gem in the area. Thank you for such a memorable meal! Hopefully more people return to Bali to try your amazing food showcasing the best this island has to offer."
101,ChIJvcoIMohH0i0RoOUc_GcwCoM,Balagra Resto Bali,Always Very Spicy,4,"A small menu with no pork products but the food was delicious nevertheless.

They are not used to customers during the day but they scrambled to cook the meals and serve our drinks professionally.

The fried chicken as illustrated was ayam kampung, a smaller bantam style hen and it‚Äôs very delicious.

The menu was small and the drinks menu much more limited but thankfully when I ordered a plain iced tea (off menu) they were happy to oblige.

Only cash accepted here. The restaurant is on the ground floor of the Atanaya Hotel."
102,ChIJvcoIMohH0i0RoOUc_GcwCoM,Balagra Resto Bali,made cublick,5,"Complete buffet breakfast, I love the taste, all delicious. I paid only 100k, i got all you can eat dan after that free swimming at rooftop pool. Awesome"
103,ChIJvcoIMohH0i0RoOUc_GcwCoM,Balagra Resto Bali,Irene Emmanuelawati,5,"Had an all you can eat breakfast and some a la carte in the evening, where all my food was served warm. The price is really worth it. Balagra is walking distance from Trans Studio Mall (TSM) Bali"
104,ChIJvcoIMohH0i0RoOUc_GcwCoM,Balagra Resto Bali,Maria Stephanie,5,The food was so delicious. The place was comfort for the kids also. They have gppd service. I will back to this resto again if I stay in Bali.
105,ChIJvcoIMohH0i0RoOUc_GcwCoM,Balagra Resto Bali,Sriram Kannan,5,We had Sunny side nasi and lava toast. It was great!
106,ChIJ28dn2hdH0i0RMJGidoQ8ilw,Mamasan Bali,Eve‚Äôs Daughter,4,Good food great service and wonderful interiors. The lamb and duck were really good and samosa chaat was sublime. The dumplings were not so good the filling was tasty but the dumpling ü•ü itself tore easily and stuck to the small ceramic cups and was basically soggy due to the melted aspic leaking (it‚Äôs the wrapper that was a fail). Have had many dumplings and this was not as good as it could have been. However overall experience was really good. I would come back :-)
107,ChIJ28dn2hdH0i0RMJGidoQ8ilw,Mamasan Bali,Fiona Coles,5,"Always top quality food and service. Loved the pork and squid salad and the snapper yellow curry with pilaf rice and cashews was just delicious. Could have a few more wines available by the glass, didn't ruin experience though, it was lovely. Excellent service from moment we arrived to the door man arranging our taxi as we left."
108,ChIJ28dn2hdH0i0RMJGidoQ8ilw,Mamasan Bali,Irwan Mursalim,4,"Good place to dine in. Their menu is mixed of Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese. Tasty and good in personal size portion.

The place has dark, rustic Asian bar vibe. It may not be suitable for family with kids but perfect for friends to hang out. Book seats ahead as it might get crowded and full seated in busy hours."
109,ChIJ28dn2hdH0i0RMJGidoQ8ilw,Mamasan Bali,Stephen Spencer,5,"An absolute stand out restaurant and easily the best meal we had in Seminyak.
Nothing was too much trouble here.
Despite failing to secure a booking we turned up at the door, and after promising to leave before the next sitting were quickly seated and served.
A request for gluten-free dishes produced a stand alone menu, staff had great tips, the food came out fast, and the dishes were wonderful.
The restaurant is in a great spot, just at the top of the main tourist area, so, easily reached by cab or walking, and inside is a big, loud, open space full of very happy people and huge numbers of staff.
Everyone was catered for ‚Äì the older couple at the table on one side, and the big family with kids on the other were all having a great time.
A must visit on any trip to Bali."
110,ChIJ28dn2hdH0i0RMJGidoQ8ilw,Mamasan Bali,Richard Sundji,5,"The food was absolutely amazing, great flavour and well presented. Cocktails were equally amazing.. the staff were extremely friendly and efficient. We had a great time and look forward to returning on our next trip to Bali. This place is a must visit"
111,ChIJ_9jHzR5d0i0Rkm0FXWXqIMY,Pala Restaurant & Rooftop Bar,Nicole Louie,5,"Came here for Sunday brunch with friends and family. It was AMAZING! There were so many different cuisines available, great bbq seafood, a dessert bar. This was the most incredible and indulgent buffet I‚Äôve ever been to"
112,ChIJ_9jHzR5d0i0Rkm0FXWXqIMY,Pala Restaurant & Rooftop Bar,Jacqui Windebank,5,"I don‚Äôt have enough good things to say about the Sunday brunch at Pala restaurant @kempinskibali

Living in Singapore we have been spoilt by many an amazing Sunday buffet champagne brunch. This goes above and beyond anything I have ever been to before!

The number of sections is extensive from French which is the main base to Italian, Mexican, Middle Eastern, Japanese and more. @jeanyvesleuranguer and his talented team put together an incredible selection of quality food.

I am more of a savoury person and usually don‚Äôt eat desserts at the brunches. Let me tell you today I had two plates and still didn‚Äôt get to try everything I wanted to. Chef Damien Piscionerie has put together a dessert selection that has to be seen to be believed. The food was beautiful and ridiculously delicious. The ice-cream selection alone was a dessert bar of it‚Äôs own and then add areas for tarts, pastries, a live crepe Suzette station and French patisserie. It was insanely good.

The Kempinski is a stunning hotel and Pala is right in the middle of the beautiful pools. The service was great and I loved the selection of aperol spritz included in the alcohol package. If I had one suggestion, it would be to include an upgrade option to champagne for those who prefer that to Prosecco. It was otherwise perfection!

Oh and they allow all brunch guests to use the pool facilities for the day as well. What is not to love!"
113,ChIJ_9jHzR5d0i0Rkm0FXWXqIMY,Pala Restaurant & Rooftop Bar,Nutharin Phusitphoykai,5,"We had a dinner at Pala Rooftop bar. It was awesome. Nice view, great service, excellent food and awesome drinks.

Many choices of cocktails and mocktails. I really likes Bali tropical mocktail. Tasty and refreshing.

Food are both Indonesian and Indian. Chefs are great. We love all the dishes we order.

It was a full moon night when we were there. Amazing big moon in the sky.

We can come back here again.
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

We also have breakfast here during our stay in Apurva Kempinski hotel.

The breakfast time is 6:30am to 10:30am.
There are many selections such as Western, Japanese, Indonesian, Chinese food.

Staff are very helpful and friendly. There are many tables both indoor and outdoor.

Food is good."
114,ChIJ_9jHzR5d0i0Rkm0FXWXqIMY,Pala Restaurant & Rooftop Bar,Daria Smirnova,5,"The beat brunch I‚Äôve had in Bali‚Ä¶ amazing food, salted salmon (which is difficult to find in Bali, everyone does smoked only), bakery, desserts, coffee, lobsters, seafood, well everything was perfect"
115,ChIJ_9jHzR5d0i0Rkm0FXWXqIMY,Pala Restaurant & Rooftop Bar,Jeje R.,3,"I recently had the opportunity to dine at Pala Restaurant for a Christmas eve dinner buffet and while the price was on the higher side, the staff were all very friendly and welcoming. The dessert selection was excellent, with a wide variety of tasty options to choose from. While the main course offerings were not as varied as I would have liked, the Ayam Betutu was unfortunately a bit dry. However, the staff were very attentive and made sure to check in on us throughout the meal to ensure we had everything we needed. All in all, it was an okay dining experience despite some minor shortcomings."
116,ChIJNz1dVBdH0i0Rpn8u0cr9drY,Cafe Bali,Azimeer Manaf,4,"Very charming cafe / restaurant at the heart of trendy Seminyak. Beautiful ID that infuse the local Bali elements but yet chic with modern touches.

Wide variety of menu incorporating both international and local dishes. They also have interesting daily specials which i think are quite reasonably priced. Service is fast and portions are quite big. Taste wise is definitely catered for the international tourists, as they lack the local punches, quite mild and palatable for western tourists.

4 stars mainly for the deco and friendly service."
117,ChIJNz1dVBdH0i0Rpn8u0cr9drY,Cafe Bali,Ross McLean,5,"One of my regular Seminyak eating spots. It has a super chill but nice atmosphere and are consistently good! Always good for brunch/coffee, or a cheeky cocktail with a great offering for dinner. They offer Gluten Free bread which is a rarity in Bali, and have all around great service and nice staff."
118,ChIJNz1dVBdH0i0Rpn8u0cr9drY,Cafe Bali,Anton ‚ÄúMotsunabe‚Äù,5,"The taste of food was great! Very cozy place, and the price was reasonable. I had steak which was tender and juicy, my wife ordered ravioli which was tasted great. The only problem is there was no parking lot, so you have to park your vehicle at some other place. In my case, i parked it at seminyak village which is around 200 mtr from the restaurant."
119,ChIJNz1dVBdH0i0Rpn8u0cr9drY,Cafe Bali,Pia Moll McCarthy,5,"Beautiful restaurant in a colonial-style building which offers a lovely respite from the busy busy main street.
For such a wide offer on the menu the taste of everything we ordered was spot on! The midday menu is so cheap and filling, very recommendable.
The juice options are surprisingly creative and tasty!!
Service was sometimes a little unattentive, but then again it was pretty quiet."
120,ChIJNz1dVBdH0i0Rpn8u0cr9drY,Cafe Bali,Lauren,5,"We came for brunch. The breakfast menu is available all day :)! We ordered Sourdough Smoked Salmon Benedict & Pesto Eggs.
The Sourdough bread is reallly good. I am normally a smoked salmon person but I would have to say that the pesto eggs was my favourite. The pesto was perfect and added a very refreshing flavour.
Coffee was normal. Nothing special (we got flat white latte & piccolo)."
121,ChIJ0x7UGRRH0i0RKa1AnlBmNfQ,Sangsaka Restaurant,Danger N,4,"I guess you would consider this place ‚Äúfancy‚Äù for Bali standards but the food was well worth it. We ordered the set menu.

Highlights:
Yellowfin tuna tart (pie tee)
Lamb croquette (add on)
Lobster dumpling with seafood bisque
Duck breast & red cabbage

Personally, the octopus dish was a bit too salty for my liking and the crab crumpet was bland.

Overall, good food and great service. We did not have to wait too long in between dishes and we were super full at the end.

Definitely worth  a visit if you wanted to treat yourself on holidays."
122,ChIJ0x7UGRRH0i0RKa1AnlBmNfQ,Sangsaka Restaurant,Mia Amalia,5,"Currently my favorite restaurant in Bali. It was so good that the 1st time we, me and my husband, knew this restaurant, we came 3 times in a week. The cocktails selection is a must try. Our favorite were Balinese Margarita and Sumatran Negroni. All the appetizers are so delicious, it is like a festive in your mouth. We have tried all of them and love all of them. 10 out of 10 star. And if you feel like you can have it all, try their tasting menu. Service was also top notch, when my daughter drop a bottle of water, the waiter came right away, I could see they don't just stand but really paid attention to the guest. One restaurant not be missed."
123,ChIJ0x7UGRRH0i0RKa1AnlBmNfQ,Sangsaka Restaurant,Thananuch Thepkanjana,5,"SUPER yummy contemporary Indonesia food. As others have mentioned, the presentation is absolutely stunning and flavours were delicious! Would definitely recommend this restaurant for friends and family. Specifically dishes that I really enjoyed include the steak, noodles and shrimp!"
124,ChIJ0x7UGRRH0i0RKa1AnlBmNfQ,Sangsaka Restaurant,Douglas Liu,5,"A really incredible meal that I enjoyed every minute of. Dishes were delicious, service was on point, good wine to go along with the meal. Really the only downside is that I stained my white shirt from gobbling up the dishes so quickly!"
125,ChIJ0x7UGRRH0i0RKa1AnlBmNfQ,Sangsaka Restaurant,Chao Shi,3,"Honest review:
Food is nicely presented but flavours are a bit confusing and some dishes need improvement. The sauces can be overpowering at times. I really hoped the food would represent the culture and tastes of Bali but a bit hit and miss.
Service: Attentive staff who seem eager to please and serve professionally.

3.5/5"
126,ChIJscGAa6JH0i0RAQWv3Vuav1Q,The bali kitchen warung seminyak,Amanda Nielson,5,I got the egg spinach bacon and toast. It was delicious. I also had the mango juice which was delicious and was very fresh and clean tasting. Not super sweet. The food was made fresh and they spoke English well. The owner greeted us and also offered to be our tour guide!
127,ChIJscGAa6JH0i0RAQWv3Vuav1Q,The bali kitchen warung seminyak,Matthew Lacey,5,"One of the best little warungs to eat at, we found ourselves eating here at least once per day. Decent sized menu with Indonesian & western foods. Everything we tried tasted great and very cheap. Staff are very friendly, decent atmosphere. Definitely recommend you give it a try.

Also known as bean box coffee shop, to help make it easier to find."
128,ChIJscGAa6JH0i0RAQWv3Vuav1Q,The bali kitchen warung seminyak,Tanya Ristoff,5,"Excellent food, excellent service, will return!
We had nasi goreng and a capcay chicken minus the chicken - both terrific."
129,ChIJscGAa6JH0i0RAQWv3Vuav1Q,The bali kitchen warung seminyak,Marlee Cram,5,Quiet and delicious homemade food. Loved the satay dish! Cheap and cheerful!
130,ChIJscGAa6JH0i0RAQWv3Vuav1Q,The bali kitchen warung seminyak,Ben Kingsbury,5,"Had a lovely fried rice here, as well as the Indonesian fried chicken. The menu is great value, and the lady is very friendly. Would highly recommend for a nice, good value meal."
131,ChIJp7V6o2FE0i0R0Vpk0XMjS4M,Cuca Restaurant,ÈôàÊµ∑ÁèÆ,3,"I had a really really high expectation of Cuca after I have read so many good reviews on google and other social media, so I have booked this restaurant as my last dinner of my Bali trip with my friend hoping to end this trip with an awesome meal. However, both me and my friend felt quite upset and a bit down after the visit. The environment and the vibe is absolutely nice. The whole staff team is so friendly and helpful! Which, made us feel even more exciting to try the food. Turned out the food quite disappointed us. After reading others review and the owner‚Äôs reply, I totally agree that different people have different tastes and Cuca is very proud of their unique invention and concept, twisting the flavors. Therefore I‚Äôm here just to share my 2 cents worth opinion. Me and my friend we are considered as very open minded person towards any food and any taste, but at Cuca, we felt there was way too much fancy flavors and texture being put into one dish but they did not resonate with each other. The flavor of some ingredients is way too strong and over power everything. Especially the beef bone marrow.  The saltiness covered the sweet from the rice and the strong herbs used in the beef overpower it‚Äôs original taste. The famous pumpkin salad, each of component is really good. But the sweetness of granola adding up on the sweetness of pumpkin made us very confused and the texture of all food ingredients together does not match each other. It‚Äôs a really lovely space, we really hope the food can be adjusted and improved to really showcase what a Asian top 10 restaurant should be like."
132,ChIJp7V6o2FE0i0R0Vpk0XMjS4M,Cuca Restaurant,Nima,5,"Booked an anniversary dinner in our last night in Bali before our flight home and I gotta say - I went in with some skepticism, but came out absolutely blown away.

We arrived for our reservation and were greeted by super friendly staff who took our bags for us and walked us to the restaurant. The property looks like a nice resort rather than a restaurant. It appears many people also hit up Cuca for dinner before the airport as our bags were quickly taken for storage and a luggage chit was given to us.

We were then taken to our table at the food bar which was a super cool experience getting to see the kitchen work. The owner and head chef would pop in and out of the kitchen and was fully aware of what was going on at all tables.

We ordered a moongria and big apple cocktail to start and both were very good. We got the chefs tasting menu which was awesome. Each course was presented very nicely and was served with an explanation of what the dish is and how to best enjoy it. The head chef / owner made it a point to deliver one of the dishes to us and explain the origins. I was quite impressed with the passion he showed in describing the dish (even after probably doing it 100 times each night).

The food was incredible and the staff were also incredible. Since we were there on an anniversary dinner we even got a photo keepsake which was a very nice gesture.

Overall this is a great dining experience which in any other destination would be fine dining, but since it‚Äôs Bali it‚Äôs nice to get the fine dining experience but have a more relaxed atmosphere. The food quality is unmatched and the staff are passionate about what they do.

Highly recommend and will definitely be back if we go to Bali again."
133,ChIJp7V6o2FE0i0R0Vpk0XMjS4M,Cuca Restaurant,chesa,5,"Flavorful, tasty and innovative menu!

I was here on NYE and I couldn't pick a better place than this one. I picked the festive menu. All foods were super tasty and unique. I've tried several other fine dining places in Bali but Cuca is the best so far. I can't wait to be back and try their other menu!
The restaurant has a great atmosphere. The only downside during my visit was being seated in the corner of the bar but maybe it was because I was by myself.
The owner & his wife were very welcoming and friendly. The staff were professional and well trained.

I highly recommend this place."
134,ChIJp7V6o2FE0i0R0Vpk0XMjS4M,Cuca Restaurant,faisal jarwo,5,What a great culinary experience. Cuca is advertised as a tapas restaurant- we did share the 9 plates of food we ordered but my suggestion is that it's far closer to fine dining. It's a place that takes you on an extraordinary culinary trip. The food is fresh and extremely well prepared (before your eyes) using local ingredients. We chose to sit at the chefs viewing table that sits along the edge of the kitchen where you can watch every detail of the preparation of your dish. Then each dish was delivered to us by the chef who described in great detail the dish and was more than keen to answer our questions.
135,ChIJp7V6o2FE0i0R0Vpk0XMjS4M,Cuca Restaurant,Luis J. Garcia,5,"This was an amazing find! The restaurant is a jewel. Place atmosphere is great and decor is outstanding. Service was top notch since we parked all the way until we left. We tried 5 different dishes and they were all fantastic, unique and flavorful. If you are in Bali and around this area, I would strongly recommend you stop here."
136,ChIJh5_-zCRH0i0RZ-5N2hPzs6A,Uni Restaurant,Jeanne A.,4,"Easy booking process through WA.
Food was beautifully presented, taste was alright, so there's a room for improvement.
What I liked most was the place, gorgeous place, well decorated, and the air con was spot on. Service was impeccable. If I didn't live that far away I'd be here every night.

Bonus for the parking space for cars, they have a staff helping you. Plenty of motorbikes parking too.

Price was not expensive, and for that well curated menu, it's considered cheap.

Oh and wifi worked pretty well too.
Cheers."
137,ChIJh5_-zCRH0i0RZ-5N2hPzs6A,Uni Restaurant,Kevin Winartoo,5,"Had our dinner here on a Friday night and love it! The place was busy, food and cocktails were great. It was an amazing experience to see what‚Äôs happening in the kitchen from the seat at the kitchen counter. The grill barramundi is perfect! Excellent service, our waiter was so friendly. We will recommend Uni to our friends and family."
138,ChIJh5_-zCRH0i0RZ-5N2hPzs6A,Uni Restaurant,Kate Brodie,5,"I‚Äôm a regular in Bali and I‚Äôm so glad we stumbled across this gem on our recent trip  - it was one of my favourite restaurants that we visited while we were there! The food was delicious, can‚Äôt fault one of the meals we had. The service was also 10/10, host and staff were so friendly and accommodating. Can‚Äôt wait to come back and visit on our next trip!"
139,ChIJh5_-zCRH0i0RZ-5N2hPzs6A,Uni Restaurant,Natalie dePasquale,5,"If you are a seafood fan, this is a must try! I am a snobby seafood fanatic from New York City and this restaurant is just like any really good spot in Manhattan. Fresh, well balanced crudo (I tried most of them). Also a nice restaurant vibe with a DJ and chill ambiance. Strong cocktail and wine list as well. Highly recommend!"
140,ChIJh5_-zCRH0i0RZ-5N2hPzs6A,Uni Restaurant,Firdaus Abdul Malik,4,"Fantastic vibes and food here. Music was on point. Highly recommended.

We got the tasting menu. Seems like that had the most bang for buck. Highlights were the scallops, fish and dessert.

The dessert was just absolutely delightful. We had the pistachio and the chocolate. The choc had a yummy honey crumble underneath and was really rich. The pistachio was a great alternative if you wanted something a little less sweet."
141,ChIJhYe90IdH0i0R3qavUpKXm_Q,Iwa Restaurant at Hotel Tugu Bali,Marni Abigail,4,"This restaurant is definitely for westerners as locals would never pay this price for food.

There was a bit of confusion as the entrance is for two different restaurants and the staff couldn‚Äôt find our reservation. Fortunately there really were barely any customers (maybe two other tables), so we could choose a table.

That being said, the food was delicious and presented nicely. The staff is very nice and friendly. I think one person was in training.
One thing I really dislike is when people pour beer into a glass like water. Please don‚Äôt do this as it will foam up ‚Äî either tilt the glass and pour or just let us pour it ourselves.

Note: don‚Äôt tip via credit card as the hotel owners will receive the money directly and not the staff. Always tip the staff in cash! This ensures they actually receive the money."
142,ChIJhYe90IdH0i0R3qavUpKXm_Q,Iwa Restaurant at Hotel Tugu Bali,Megan Richards,5,"We had an unforgettable experience at Iwa! The food was exceptional, they offer both Balinese and Javanese traditional cuisine that is elevated to to the level of some of the best restaurants in Melbourne, Australia. It was both delicious and considered with all of the elements of crunch, acidity, sweetness, umami and salt. It was on the pricier end for Indonesian food, but it is worth it for the effort put in by the chef to prepare such a grand take on the dishes. The atmosphere of the restaurant is beautiful and our server last night, Putu, was wonderful! She explained the menu, was attentive and we ended up having some great conversation with her as well which made our experience even better! Highly recommended!!!"
143,ChIJhYe90IdH0i0R3qavUpKXm_Q,Iwa Restaurant at Hotel Tugu Bali,gian david,5,The restaurant is set inside the beautiful Hotel Tugu Bali. It has this magical atmosphere of traditional Indonesia. The staff was very highly accommodating. So many choices of food from Indonesian to Western cuisine. But I highly recommend this restaurant for an authentic Indonesian fine dining experience.

145,ChIJhYe90IdH0i0R3qavUpKXm_Q,Iwa Restaurant at Hotel Tugu Bali,Cindy Tan,1,"Not sure about the 5 star ratings. Food was very basic, we ordered a Nasi Goreng, Ayam Soto and Kuning tofu, the tofu was stale. Plates and Cups were dirty, we have had to change a few times. Overall- not recommended if you are looking for authentic local cuisine. The past reviews are questionable."

151,ChIJh3iFG8Rc0i0Rdn7vSvmbcTA,Paon Bali Resto & Bar,John Cradock,5,"We ordered the Balinese rijstaffel for two for dinner. Everything was great, especially the pork satay. Though it's not a problem for me but the food can get quite spicy.

Hilton Honors members get 25% discount, which is a bonus."
152,ChIJh3iFG8Rc0i0Rdn7vSvmbcTA,Paon Bali Resto & Bar,Ê∏∏ÁÄöÁøî,1,"I recently dined at this restaurant and I have to say that it was a complete scam! The Friday BBQ is an absolute ripoff at 550K IDR. The food selection was minimal, and definitely not worth the price. I would rather opt for a hotel buffet instead. Even the drinks are not included in the price, which is a complete disappointment.

If you're looking to dine here, I highly recommend skipping the BBQ and opting for in-room dining instead. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with my experience and would not recommend this restaurant.

In addition to the disappointing food selection and pricing, the dance performance was also lackluster."
153,ChIJh3iFG8Rc0i0Rdn7vSvmbcTA,Paon Bali Resto & Bar,Affinity MM,5,We had the rijstaffel style meal for two and it was so delicious! The restaurant staff were also very attentive and helpful. Overall very good food and serviceüëç
154,ChIJh3iFG8Rc0i0Rdn7vSvmbcTA,Paon Bali Resto & Bar,Victoria Ross,5,"If you love seafood and are travelling to Bali - this place is a MUST to visit.

Hands down the BEST grilled Balinese prawns I‚Äôve tried."

Super friendly staff and good food, for a nice price. I was in Bali for 2 weeks 14 nights and went there minimum 9 times. Also can someone please send me the socials for Leo. :) (to: arnooee on ig)"
158,ChIJqeMeDN1G0i0R3f77UJU73Os,Balibagus Resto,Trevor Smyth,5,"Fantastic little restaurant on Padma Utara virtually next door to Posers Bar.
Simple menu with both local and western dishes.
It was quite full the nite we visited with many tables being turned over for hungry patrons...many western clientele.
We tried the spring rolls and Nasi and Mie Goreng for mains.
Both excellent choices and plenty of chunky chicken and veges pieces in both dishes.
Staff very friendly and cool 60's music playing throughout.
With 3 drinks our bill was just under 150k , so inexpensive and the best part - no tax !
Highly recommended...and tip them handsomely."

161,ChIJKWD5VBdH0i0ReivZYCJIm24,BATIK Restaurant Bar,David Paul Elliott,4,"Nice place, clean, comfortable and good service. Reasonable prices food and drinks.
Partner had Thai papaya salad , whilst plenty not enough spice or fish sauce to please her taste. I had the Thai chicken Green curry with rice. Again plenty but not exceptional.
Overall good value and relaxing  restaurant. We had the meal inside and vacated to the outside for cocktails. We will visit again."
162,ChIJKWD5VBdH0i0ReivZYCJIm24,BATIK Restaurant Bar,aurel,4,"Staff was very nice and helpful, the ambiance is great for lunch or dinner with friends and families. The parking though very limited, we have to park our car in the sidewalk. there‚Äôs some minor thing i would like to point out though, maybe it would be better for the cook and everyone in the kitchen to wear hairnet to refrain the object being inside of foods."
163,ChIJKWD5VBdH0i0ReivZYCJIm24,BATIK Restaurant Bar,Rayneedshelp,5,"the place is genuinely wonderful. the atmosphere when you walk into the restaurant is nice, and it'd been surprising to me considering how i randomly chose this place over all others and didn't have any expectations at all. i loved the food! theyre all so perfectly seasoned. i had a nice time here. :)"
164,ChIJKWD5VBdH0i0ReivZYCJIm24,BATIK Restaurant Bar,Sel Cap,5,"The green curry is amazing! And other dishes also ggod, the hamburguer with some sauce on top which we didn't understood why.
Not so many options of wine by glass. The last day ( I have been several times here) I went I couldn't have a second glass of wine because it was finished.
Ambiance is amazing.
Great service
Air-conditioned
Great location"
165,ChIJKWD5VBdH0i0ReivZYCJIm24,BATIK Restaurant Bar,Stephanie Rose,4,"Batik is a South East Asian inspired restaurant on one of the main streets in Seminyak. The stunning colonial building caught our eye and we took a seat on their front deck, fit with rattan furniture and marble top tables. I highly recommend the Salmon Teriyaki dish, it was so tasty! Pair that with a Strawberry Caipiroska and it‚Äôs a perfect lunch"
166,ChIJo1GWBj490i0RXWp2SA0I2ZA,BLANCO par Mandif,D J M,5,"Fine dining that does not disappoint. Presentation is impressive and the dishes are unique. Wine list could be improved, but the cocktail pairing was excellent and overall a memorable experience."
167,ChIJo1GWBj490i0RXWp2SA0I2ZA,BLANCO par Mandif,Jenny Arnott,5,Fantastic experience. The food was amazing. You can tell how much thought and passion has gone into creating the menu and the paired cocktails/drinks. The staff are clearly also passionate and knowledgeable about the food. A once in a lifetime experience.
168,ChIJo1GWBj490i0RXWp2SA0I2ZA,BLANCO par Mandif,M L,5,"2022.05.28, a 5/5 after lock down! Fantastic ingredients with amazing taste. The sequence, service, and the drink pairing are excellent with local herbs and twist.

Highly recommend for anyone would try quality food in Ubud!!"
169,ChIJo1GWBj490i0RXWp2SA0I2ZA,BLANCO par Mandif,mikayla dunne,5,Incredible experience at Blanco tonight! Service was top notch with descriptions of all plates served. The food came out quick also. Every dish was delicious with special mention to the duck and tomato consume.
170,ChIJo1GWBj490i0RXWp2SA0I2ZA,BLANCO par Mandif,Kristina Hariyani,4,"We enjoyed almost all of our courses. The Tuna, vongole, & the dessert getuk are our most favorite. Good service & ambiance. Nice beverage pairings. I took 1 star off because there was a leakage near their toilet so it was slippery and because of their overly sweet duck & lamb."
171,ChIJYewZo6RG0i0Rz6Dix0xA-dk,Gabah Restaurant & Bar,Arnav Bora,4,"It was our first night in Bali and we were a bit jet lagged. So, we decided to take a quick walk from Mercure hotel and we reached this beautiful, very authentic looking restaurant.

The staff there greeted us well. The staff were courteous and kind enough to explain the dishes to us. We ordered some local delicacies and loved the dishes. Though they took more than half an hour to serve our order, the dishes were freshly prepared and did taste good.

On the drinks menu not all the beers were available from the menu.

The ambience is lit yet classy and has an authentic balinese look & feel.

Considering their good service, the amount served and the ambience, the prices seemed fine to us.

Overall, we had a nice experience and recommend this place."
172,ChIJYewZo6RG0i0Rz6Dix0xA-dk,Gabah Restaurant & Bar,Foodie Maison,5,"We walked in here without reservation. The First impression was that the people here were so nice especially Miss Arik.
She introduced the traditional Indonesian cuisine to us really well.
The atmosphere was also great!
The most important thing is that the food was really tasty.
I recommend here."
173,ChIJYewZo6RG0i0Rz6Dix0xA-dk,Gabah Restaurant & Bar,Sir Galileo,2,"Not for seafood order. The crab was not fresh and not cooked properly. The other food were ok. Customer service was fine, but cleanliness was something they can still improve. Maybe the old reviews were overated as we chose this restaurant based on it."
174,ChIJYewZo6RG0i0Rz6Dix0xA-dk,Gabah Restaurant & Bar,Shahram K.,5,"Very nice environment with perfect indonesian food.

The price is reasonable with high quality and fresh ingredient. The food is also well presented.

Staffs are friendly and welcoming."
175,ChIJYewZo6RG0i0Rz6Dix0xA-dk,Gabah Restaurant & Bar,Niyom Kaseng,5,"Very impressive restaurant to serve local dish to the luxurious class, unforgettable experience in Kuta that you need to come and select one of the many to be your meal.

The food is delicious and well prepared. The staffs are highly active and ready to alert to trace your order."
176,ChIJHYu1nRlH0i0RdPb1-zIWMgw,Mauri Restaurant,chesa,5,"The whole experience exceeded my expectation.
I'd tried a few of fine dining restaurant in Bali and they're usually overrated. It's definitely NOT the case for Mauri.
I was here on their 3rd anniversary in November and tried the tasting menu (5 courses).
Portion and proportion are good as you get a lot of varieties and courses.
Foods are tasty and presented beautifully.
Price is reasonable for a fine dining place and tasting menu service.
All staff are attentive and professional.
The head came to our table and made sure that we had a great dinner experience.
Overall, Mauri is highly recommended, especially to those looking for a fine dining experience in Bali."
177,ChIJHYu1nRlH0i0RdPb1-zIWMgw,Mauri Restaurant,Andrew Sayer,5,"I rarely give five stars yet this establishment deserves six. The service was impeccable, friendly and prompt. The cleanliness, modern decor and open planned architecture was welcoming and refreshing.

The Signature Tasting Menu was simply divine. The flavours and fresh ingredients  blended and balanced wonderfully. It was an absolute privilege to dine here. Thank you to the front of house and kitchen staff."
178,ChIJHYu1nRlH0i0RdPb1-zIWMgw,Mauri Restaurant,SHANNON MAY,5,"This was first time to Mauri restaurant after searching somewhere nice to try for my partner‚Äôs birthday. It was a great experience in all aspects. The wine list is extensive to match the delicious tasting menus, the creatively designed meals offer tasty eats that get the pallet going for the entire experience. The staff are engaging, friendly and their meal/wine terminology on point. We met the head chef who is very experienced and it was clearly evident in his menu design and presentation. All round lovely experience that we will pass on to our friends and family visiting Bali to recommend and enjoy. Thank you!"
179,ChIJHYu1nRlH0i0RdPb1-zIWMgw,Mauri Restaurant,Nicole Wong,5,Booked Mauri for our anniversary dinner. Ordered one discovery tasting menu and one signature tasting menu. Food was exceptional. Each dish is nice. We got a chocolate mousse as an complimentary dessert from the restaurant. The mousse is very smooth. Would come again if we revisit Bali.
180,ChIJHYu1nRlH0i0RdPb1-zIWMgw,Mauri Restaurant,Aaron Salim,5,"Came for a Sunday brunch because of the reputable chef. For 800k you are entertained for three hours with his skills and high quality ingredients. Everything is served beautifully and the service is not disappointing too. Arguably, it came down to be the best valued brunch in Bali and not a bad decision to try."
181,ChIJURMfBbYi0i0RFB8UdQswuY4,Jungle Fish Bali,R Majed,5,"I rarely comment on anything, but this restaurant is the best in Bali ü•∞ü•∞.. seriously I went there three times in a row and each Time I feel so refresh and happy.. the food is very very yummy and the service is beyond description. Try the coffee it‚Äôs super delicious and the sweets too!!üòçüòçüòã in the pictures below, my family and I ordered  these dishes during the three days we went there. The waiters and head chef are very nice and very welcoming, and the view is breathtaking in the day time .. . I recommend it for anyone in Bali. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüåπüåπ"
182,ChIJURMfBbYi0i0RFB8UdQswuY4,Jungle Fish Bali,Silvia Lucia Sampugnaro,5,"This a marvellous place inside the Chepung Sebali Resort. I booked a sunbed to spend the afternoon (350k-very good deal and usable for food/drinks). The atmosphere is so relaxing and the pool bar is absolutely beautiful. Staff very courteous and dedicated to the guests, they are always smiling. Both food and drinks were on point with great selection of Indonesian and Western options plus vegetarian. Had great time and I highly recommend it! Will go back ü§ó"
183,ChIJURMfBbYi0i0RFB8UdQswuY4,Jungle Fish Bali,Ghaith Ayadi,5,"I think this is the quintessential Ubud experience. Inside a jungle and rice terraces at the same time. Elegant, upscale and tasteful. I love the Balinese style. The execution is excellent. Food was nothing to write home about. Pizza is straight up bad. But that's not why you come here. The experience is otherwise flawless. The road to get there is a lot of fun on a motorbike. Highly recommended"
184,ChIJURMfBbYi0i0RFB8UdQswuY4,Jungle Fish Bali,talita adam,5,"Awesome, surprising and spectacular! Unexpected luxury in the middle of the jungle. Good food, nice staff, one of a kind views. But they did offer us water as soon as we sat down and charged us 55k for it which we did not expect. Otherwise a must have experience!"
185,ChIJURMfBbYi0i0RFB8UdQswuY4,Jungle Fish Bali,Anthony Legeay,5,Amazing experience!! We spend the whole day there and the atmosphere is really chill. We had the Katsu Bowl and the Coconut curry which were delicious. You can stay on daybeds and enjoy the pool. Staff was amazing and very kind.
186,ChIJ2e7HkX4i0i0R_Xq96K4pFd8,Boni Bali Restaurant,Isabelle Pik√∂rn,5,"Most beautiful setting, lovely staff, fantastic photo opportunities and the food was delicious too - much bigger portions that expected. Very quite despite having great views of the rice terraces, you feel like you‚Äôre in your own private paradise. Be prepared for a little walk up a steep drive way though ;)"
187,ChIJ2e7HkX4i0i0R_Xq96K4pFd8,Boni Bali Restaurant,P√©ter Hertelendy,5,"Amazing place, great view, nice staff and delicious food."
188,ChIJ2e7HkX4i0i0R_Xq96K4pFd8,Boni Bali Restaurant,Lisa Lou,5,"If you‚Äôre visiting the rice terraces and swings you really must venture a little further up the road past the final swing spot to Boni Bali Restaurant. We enjoyed a delicious lunch here today with an absolutely amazingly beautiful outlook. Having newly reopened after 2 years closure due to the Covid pandemic, this place is definitely worth visiting. The staff are friendly and attentive, the food and drinks delicious! Vegetarian and vegan options. Highly recommend!"
189,ChIJ2e7HkX4i0i0R_Xq96K4pFd8,Boni Bali Restaurant,Dawn Miller,5,"Visiting from Australia, and would 100% recommend! Beautiful views atop the rice fields and delicious food for a great price!"
190,ChIJ2e7HkX4i0i0R_Xq96K4pFd8,Boni Bali Restaurant,Ellie Tran,4,"I chose the Nasi Campur from the Balinese food selection and it was a fabulous choice! Taste the sides and mix all the ones you like in with the rice. The accompanying soup was delicious! We went during midday when it was clear so there was a great view of the nearby rice terrace (although other restaurants had a better view, after rice terrace hiking, I had enough of the rice terrace anyway)."
191,ChIJQZUR291G0i0RW9WfrUPX4jI,Chapter 2 Restaurant & Bar,zoemcardle Australia,5,"We spent our last night at Chapter 2 and absolutely loved it. The food was amazing, staff so lively and the cocktails..... next level delicious! They had a live band which played many requests and we mingled and danced with lots of new friends we met that evening. A very memorable experience and highly recommend a visit. We will definitely be back!"
192,ChIJQZUR291G0i0RW9WfrUPX4jI,Chapter 2 Restaurant & Bar,Mark Snelson,5,"A breath of fresh air welcome back Bali and amazing food.
we went several times in the 2 weeks we have been here. Staff super friendly and helpful and on one night met the owners who were so apologetic that they were full and couldn't get a table  but that was all good and hey speaks volumes to the quality of the food and atmosphere and how amazing this place is - we will be back for more !"
193,ChIJQZUR291G0i0RW9WfrUPX4jI,Chapter 2 Restaurant & Bar,Jason Clark,2,"I didn't come here to drink and maybe that was my mistake that I tried to eat the food sober.

The chicken wings were passable but nothing special at all about them.  The beef pie was both burned and lukewarm at the same time which is pretty scary.  The chocolate mousse was rich but not very fluffy like a mousse is supposed to be.  It was also had a grainy texture to it as if they didn't melt the chocolate and incorporate the sugar correctly.  It was also old as it had formed a skin on top.  The banana smoothie I ordered had nothing smoothie about it.  Bananas blended with water and ice.

Nothing here would be worth what they're asking at even half the price."
194,ChIJQZUR291G0i0RW9WfrUPX4jI,Chapter 2 Restaurant & Bar,G M,2,"Overrated.  Had high expectations being a very popular and recommended place to drink, eat good food and have fun. We mustve missed the bus or maybe just the chose the wrong day - arrived early for dinner tonight. Service was slow although there were only 2 other groups there. 40mins between drinks served & first dish arriving to table. Pork knuckle was overcooked and dry, whole snapper also overcooked and dry. Pork belly just cooked..not tender. Tbone steak was dry. The only enjoyable meal was the fish n chips. Miegoreng chicken was the worst ive ever tasted in Bali - absolutely no taste. Not sure if this was an off day for the kitchen but we were disappointed. Staff lovely enough but overly eager to keep asking to refill drinks. At least its ticked off the bucket list but wont be in a rush to get back.

The place filled up shortly after dinner and it is definitely more a drinking hole with more emphasis on drinks/cocktails than good food. So stay away if its good food your looking for."
195,ChIJQZUR291G0i0RW9WfrUPX4jI,Chapter 2 Restaurant & Bar,Sandi Boorn,5,"Great restaurant for breakfast, the best lattes in Legian. If you like a hot coffee ask for hot and strong. Everytime the coffee was great. Had breakfast there multiple times and recommend Smashed Avo, Omelette, French Toast, Eggs Benedict just to name a few."
196,ChIJdZa5pqdD0i0R6S9PqkjLIFY,Bumbu Bali Restaurant & Cooking School,Rajib Ahsan Kader,4,"I went there to try Balinese foods with family including kids aged 13 and 10. From net we found out this one as a famous and authentic restaurant for Balinese and Indonesian foods.

Their waitress helped us to order from range of menus.
The price was quite expensive.
Loved their environment, flavorful and mouth-watering  foods. Also liked there presentation of foods."
197,ChIJdZa5pqdD0i0R6S9PqkjLIFY,Bumbu Bali Restaurant & Cooking School,Pierre M,5,"This fabulous place served authentic tasting, but presented on a next level balinese cuisine. With that amount of delicious food the only flaw was that we needed more fluffy rice. Reasonable prices and the servers went above and beyond for us. What an enjoyable experience after a long morning of water sports at Benoa."
198,ChIJdZa5pqdD0i0R6S9PqkjLIFY,Bumbu Bali Restaurant & Cooking School,Kamila Olszewska,5,I really liked the place. The staff was friendly- they welcomed us with singing and gave us small flowers. The food was great - the form of presentation was very impressive and it was really delicious. The prices were reasonable. It was definitely a good choice to visit Bumbu Bali.
199,ChIJdZa5pqdD0i0R6S9PqkjLIFY,Bumbu Bali Restaurant & Cooking School,Trevor (Trev),5,"Our first time bay since Covid and well worth the visit.
The main area has been renovated and has a different layout.
As always, great service and range of flavours and meals.
It was good to see some of the same staff too."
200,ChIJdZa5pqdD0i0R6S9PqkjLIFY,Bumbu Bali Restaurant & Cooking School,Lily Errante,5,"This restaurant was a really lovely surprise! They welcome you with a frangipani flower at the entrance and then they give you some spices prawn crackers with the spicy samba super yummy. We ordered the set menu the Rijsttafel and prawn skewers and it was enough for the 5 of us (we weren‚Äôt much hungry). If you order this it will come
With a few different option of curry and appetizer, vegetables and different serves of rice; and a delicious soup as a starter.
The set menu also includes different type of sweets like pancake, ice cream, coconut rolls, rice pudding and fruits. Very lovely dinner experience."
201,ChIJZRao86M90i0RWDXbSIypCzw,Wedja Bali,Stevanus Samuel,4,"From parking area, you must walk a little far inside. There is pebble path so maybe will difficult for guest who using wheelchair. A little different menu with the old one, the price is much higher with new menu. They have amazing view and good ambience with koi pond. The plating is good but the taste a little weird."
202,ChIJZRao86M90i0RWDXbSIypCzw,Wedja Bali,Honest Reviewer321,5,"A magical setting, surrounded by beautiful plantation and calming scenery. The whole restaurant is spacious and even offers an outdoor pool and massages. This would be a great place to work remotely.

We both had dishes from the breakfast menu, the Sunrise breakfast (pictured) was really fresh and has kept me full all day. My partner had the Eggs Benedict which she said were delicious. The coffee was great and overall this was a perfect start to our journey in Bali.

We hope to be back soon! üå¥"
203,ChIJZRao86M90i0RWDXbSIypCzw,Wedja Bali,Ranjit Gill,4,"Such a beautiful restaurant with great surroundings. Our driver brought us here and said it was good food at local prices. Slightly outside the city centre but certainly value for money. The two of us ate with soft drinks for ¬£8 in total. Apparently this place was very busy before the pandemic and known amongst the locals. There was hardly anyone there when we went, so no atmosphere. Hopefully things return to pre pandemic levels."
204,ChIJZRao86M90i0RWDXbSIypCzw,Wedja Bali,Stacey Gwiliam,5,"Absolutely beautiful restaurant! The service was beyond amazing, ALL staff are extremely welcoming and friendly! And the food is fresh and delicious you can tell love has been put into it. The atmosphere is perfect from the location and the people. We are from the UK and will be back to bali soon to visit again!"
205,ChIJZRao86M90i0RWDXbSIypCzw,Wedja Bali,Aris,3,"I think this place is suitable for relaxing. For example to talk business, chatting casually with relatives, or eat alone while spending time. I think this place is not suitable for a quick meal.  If you are starving, you should choose other places that can serve food quickly. That was my first experience coming here, where I came with my family and take ordered around 12.00 WITA but we received food around 14.00 WITA.  For drinks served faster about 15-30 minutes after I ordered. The taste of the food is very delicious, but the look of the food is medium, and the price is so high."

The food is really decent - tastes local but influenced by Western presentation & flavors. Yum. Great price, too. I would ride a motorbike to eat here if I was staying in Ubud center but really I feel like it's more for a regular repeat customer thing, if you live in Ubud & stay less than 5-10 minutes away üòÄ"
217,ChIJ63XU7Lwi0i0R1SXlTl1pUx4,Labak Sari Restaurant,Peter de Bruijn,5,"Thank you Wayan, your place is truly amazing, we just passed by and stopped, so happy we did! Besides the view and location, the food is just, well, more than amazing!! The traditional Balinese dishes like urab and the eggplant are so delicious! Prices are not even modest, but low. Whenever you are around, please stop, enjoy the view, friendly staff and amazing food!!"
218,ChIJ63XU7Lwi0i0R1SXlTl1pUx4,Labak Sari Restaurant,NoahJon Marshall,5,"highly recommended. food is excellent (pork ribs and spiced shrimp tasted exactly how I was hoping they would), service is easy and fast and the view/surrounds are great. plenty of parking. road to get there is a bit small and winding so be careful. would definitely go again. only criticism would be to bring mosquito spray if you go at night, but otherwise one of the best keep secrets in Ubud."
219,ChIJ63XU7Lwi0i0R1SXlTl1pUx4,Labak Sari Restaurant,Fabbiana Lopez,5,"This place is perfect if you are on a budget but you like to eat tasty food and appreciated a nature view. Both my husband and I came here every day for 1 week, and asked for the same 2 plates, vegan made and asked to add tofu on it (they adapt to your preferences and are super friendly). Highly recommended."
220,ChIJ63XU7Lwi0i0R1SXlTl1pUx4,Labak Sari Restaurant,Yugo Prabowo,5,"We had a big lunch here. This place is surrounded by greenery views. The food was amazing and affordable.

Their tempe goreng was so good. We couldn‚Äôt help it and order another plate of tempe.

I would recommend you to order their juices with no sugar."
221,ChIJ7aMbz9Ii0i0RoGosbyjUuNs,Kubu at Mandapa,Selina L,5,"We reserved one of their private cocoons and the experience was totally worth it. They picked you up with a buggy / golf car, and the way in is already breathtaking. I suggest to book an earlier time slot as much as you can so you get some good pictures before sunsets. The service is spot on - you can even charge your phone in the cocoon. One comment though is the female bathroom perhaps can do a bit of scent/fragrance."
222,ChIJ7aMbz9Ii0i0RoGosbyjUuNs,Kubu at Mandapa,Rock,5,"Absolutely flawless..
The venue, the service, the staff having attention to detail and of course the food was all absolutely astounding.
You guys gave me a dining experience I will remember forever.

Thank you and keep up the amazing work guys!"
223,ChIJ7aMbz9Ii0i0RoGosbyjUuNs,Kubu at Mandapa,Justin Loh,5,"Food, fantastic. Ambience, perfect. Experience, unforgettable.

The dinner we had at Kubu was one of the best we had in Bali. From the buggy ride to the service, we left without a single complain."
224,ChIJ7aMbz9Ii0i0RoGosbyjUuNs,Kubu at Mandapa,Kyawt Thiri Nyunt,5,"This was such a memorable experience for both my husband and I. Beyond the food, the staff, the ambience, and the plating made the experience more special. They take you in a buggy ride from the hotel lobby to the restaurant. I was able to book a private cocoon in advanced and really recommend doing so. We did the tasting menu and really appreciated how each dish was though out and executed. It was also cute that the petit fours came in a basket that is woven exactly like the cocoon. Staff are so kind and professional. I know some reviews say the price is a little high. But we live in New York City and have paid so much more for tasting menus where the quality and service is not even close to Kubu. So I would say it‚Äôs definitely a must visit place in Bali if you like fine dining."
225,ChIJ7aMbz9Ii0i0RoGosbyjUuNs,Kubu at Mandapa,Jo Sauter,5,"This was a journey of delicious flavours in a beautiful, romantic setting. Highly recommend booking a cocoon and eating no lunch, so you have enough room for multiple courses."
226,ChIJQVn3YsdG0i0R9PrNddjDEVY,Nasi Bali Restaurant Legian,Travelling Nomad,4,"Very nice place. The wine is a huge glass, which is great.
The food is tasty, but like most places around here, portions are rather small. I often joke that they're kids size and indeed, they feel like that. At the same time, the dessert was huge. Banana split with 3 ice cream scoops. Delicious.
I like the interior too. Being close to the street means a lot of noise, but aside from that, everything else was fine."
227,ChIJQVn3YsdG0i0R9PrNddjDEVY,Nasi Bali Restaurant Legian,Sonia Myers,5,"We just keep going back because the food is so good! Steaks are awesome, the Chicken Cordon Bleu its outstanding, and the banana fritters have to finish it off. Lovely staff and surroundings. Please go, you will be happy."
228,ChIJQVn3YsdG0i0R9PrNddjDEVY,Nasi Bali Restaurant Legian,Clarissaa Mizuki,4,"The food is not too bad. Place feels like a little courtyard once you enter restaurant, even though the noisy road is just right outside. Music is good too with all the classic rock music, loud enough to drown out the outside world. However, I‚Äôm giving 4 stars because I saw a huge rat coming in and out of the restaurant like it‚Äôs part of the service crew! It‚Äôs quite hilarious as the rat even took a few moments to stand beside the waiter without him noticing. I just hope the kitchen isn‚Äôt infested or dirty in any way."
229,ChIJQVn3YsdG0i0R9PrNddjDEVY,Nasi Bali Restaurant Legian,Tirta Yansen,4,"Had a breakfast here during my stay in Legian.
It's a nice restaurant  with a very traditional Balinese touch to it.
It is located in the same place as the Adi Dharma hotel.
I will try to stay here next time."
230,ChIJQVn3YsdG0i0R9PrNddjDEVY,Nasi Bali Restaurant Legian,Hui Chin Chong,4,"Good ambience, with live band and 2 singers. The pork rib soup is surprisingly good, rich with spices eg:lemongrass. Since I like spicy food, this soup is perfect for after a day of walking.
Avagado chicken salad is so so."
231,ChIJ32RppuFG0i0RX2mUvnb758E,The Plantation Grill - Seminyak,nicole,3,"Just average. Used to go years back and it was much better. Staying in the hotel and despite free table, got asked to sit at one despite asking for another. I was told it‚Äôs reserved. When left it was still free as half of the restaurant. Cocktails not balanced. Wouldn‚Äôt go back despite staying in the hotel . Added the pictures of the empty table I wanted and the one beside me. They could plan better. Found food also average in quality."
232,ChIJ32RppuFG0i0RX2mUvnb758E,The Plantation Grill - Seminyak,Paul Dunnavant,5,"Plantation Grill is a delicious steakhouse. The ambiance is amazing; there's an opera singer for several minutes at the top of each hour.

The food itself -- amazing! The filet I ordered was cooked to perfection. The mashed potatoes were buttery, creamy, and delicious. The Caesar salad and cheesecake dessert were awesome as well! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüëç"
233,ChIJ32RppuFG0i0RX2mUvnb758E,The Plantation Grill - Seminyak,Eve‚Äôs Daughter,5,"Beautiful restaurant and interiors, wonderful attentive staff, great music and very clean cutlery. The food itself was really good too. The salmon pizza was so sublime we had to order seconds! Oysters were amazing and so was the burger. My favourite dish was the Gindara ü§§The free bread and house butter when you start is also so good you will have to try and not eat too much at the start üòÖ we got a free opera singer as well for entertainment"
234,ChIJ32RppuFG0i0RX2mUvnb758E,The Plantation Grill - Seminyak,Aditya Gollakota,4,"This place has a great vibe to it with its early 1900s theme. When you first sit down the waiter offers you a selection of breads along with French and locally produced butter.
We ordered 2 starters, 2 sides and 2 mains for the two of us and it was more than enough food.
The wines are quite pricey, although the cocktails are more reasonable in price.
Service is excellent and they even had a saxophonist entertaining the patrons with some jazz."
235,ChIJ32RppuFG0i0RX2mUvnb758E,The Plantation Grill - Seminyak,Lee Wayne,4,"Excellent place for a date night. It has nice vibe with really excellent service. Every hour there‚Äôs opera singing performance which we enjoyed a lot.

Positive and recommendation: oysters and duck croquettes. Gindara fish is very good

Not up to expectation: the plantation ribeye somehow lacked the punch and it‚Äôs the only dish we didn‚Äôt finish.

Somehow we feel that the kick starter bites overshadowed some of the mains."
236,ChIJj0tR_mpH0i0RP5h_ieNuzAs,La Baracca Bali,chew dorothy,5,"Pizza is very good.  Only bummer is that smoking is allowed indoors. Otherwise, we would return again for the food.

Day 2: we returned again and we're nt disappointed. The pasta was great! Remember to ask for Al dente if u like it done right. Sou vide beef was good too.

Service is friendly n helpful."
237,ChIJj0tR_mpH0i0RP5h_ieNuzAs,La Baracca Bali,deri slyrova,4,"Good selections of pasta.
They serve pork here. But you can see from their menu.
Their pasta is aldente. And they give you welcome bread as well.
Their taste is need more kicks for indonesian.
When checkout you will get free lemoncielo or other alcohol drinks as well for free. The drinks was legit. I like"
238,ChIJj0tR_mpH0i0RP5h_ieNuzAs,La Baracca Bali,Leevy Violyta,5,"Food taste great, some friends recommended this place and it does meet our expectation. Ravioli well cooked, can taste the cheese and tomato sauce also well seasoned. Calzone pizza dough also great. They served free welcome bread and limoncello after dinner. Warm service by the staffs, and also owner greet each tables personally. Overall we satisfied and will come back again to try their other menus."
239,ChIJj0tR_mpH0i0RP5h_ieNuzAs,La Baracca Bali,Su D,5,Fantastic food. Authentic Italian food and nice atmosphere. Price for pizza around 100rph-159rph. Must try parma pizza and all their signature dish. Will definitely come back.
240,ChIJj0tR_mpH0i0RP5h_ieNuzAs,La Baracca Bali,Bob Oceans,5,"My favorite Italian restaurant so far! It‚Äôs proper Italian food, proper dough, proper Italian pizza, I can‚Äôt stop going there, the staff have a contagious smile and beautiful energy! The place is cozy and so beautiful, and the food ahhh, I can‚Äôt describe it in words, all i can say, is, if you are in Bali, anywhere, any area, take a taxi and go try this restaurant! It‚Äôs a MUST try! Thank you Baracca verdad ustedes son los mejores! Gracias!"
241,ChIJsZNw9T1D0i0R5jJEUBWUOC4,Raja Bali - Balinese Authentic Restaurant & Activities (Main Restaurant),Nick Blyth,5,"Best Balinese food we have had. We had the tasting platter and the food was amazing. Great relaxed atmosphere, staff were really friendly and helpful and they arranged pick up and drop off to our hotel Melia Bali. If your looking for a great Balinese dinner in the Nusa Dua area. I highly recommend."
242,ChIJsZNw9T1D0i0R5jJEUBWUOC4,Raja Bali - Balinese Authentic Restaurant & Activities (Main Restaurant),Diah Suryandari,5,Very good place for MICE event. Higly recommended if you have Wedding Event in this beautiful place. The food was delicious and has Balinese Authentic taste. I really love it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
243,ChIJsZNw9T1D0i0R5jJEUBWUOC4,Raja Bali - Balinese Authentic Restaurant & Activities (Main Restaurant),Bali Villa 4U,5,"Last Friday 21st May we were fortunate enough to be invited to the opening of this new Cultural experience in South Bali and from the beginning of the evening to the culmination at the end it is obvious this facility will certainly suit a variety of needs. From Weddings to Meetings to Tourist Groups enjoying Cooking classes & Dancing lessons it is going to fill a much needed gap to all that is AUTHENTIC BALINESE.
We were impressed with various wedding costumes from a variety of provinces on parade and the finest of detail is sure to impress any Wedding planner.
Excellent authentic Balinese cuisine was provided and obvious much training for the knowledgeable staff who were only happy to please.
The building and grounds also give a feel of quality but not forgetting what they represent. True Bali!
We are not related to the owners of this business just regular happy clients and simply are very impressed with the efforts made.
If seeking a venue for Conference or Meetings in a relaxed environment or a Wedding venue or just wanting to please your Tourist group you would be wise to consider Raja Bali Authentic Restaraunt and Venue Centre or if not seeking a group venue visit its sister establishments Raja Bali at Nusa Dua gates or Mr Bobs in 2 Nusa Dua locations."
244,ChIJsZNw9T1D0i0R5jJEUBWUOC4,Raja Bali - Balinese Authentic Restaurant & Activities (Main Restaurant),Esther Willaert,5,"Are you a foodie and curious about the local cuisine? Try Raja Bali! The restaurant is slightly hidden (located behind Mr. Bob's restaurant), but worth your visit. It is a little more upscale than the average local restaurant, with elegantly presented Balinese/Indonesian dishes and attentive staff. Overall a great experience!"
245,ChIJsZNw9T1D0i0R5jJEUBWUOC4,Raja Bali - Balinese Authentic Restaurant & Activities (Main Restaurant),Komang Artana,5,"A must go of new dining and special for event destination where guests are going to be pampered with unique Balinese Food, Cooking Class and other Balinese Unique experiences in one stop of this latest destination."
246,ChIJm_sdCNNc0i0RIJmaIzLcoJA,Kayuputi Restaurant,Anish Vin,5,Everything about this restaurant is perfect!! The food is exquisite and the service is a perfect level of attentive but not annoying. Staff go out of their way to assist. The food is something you will only find in top restaurants and clearly a lot of thought has gone into the menu. The brunch is the best way to experience the restaurant as you can sample everything and eat as much as you want!! Don't even think twice if you contemplating going here. I recommend the Saturday brunch. It is well worth the price and will probably be the best food you eat in Bali!!
247,ChIJm_sdCNNc0i0RIJmaIzLcoJA,Kayuputi Restaurant,Raymond Qifeng Cheang,5,My partner and I had the degustation menu. The price was affordable than what we were used to back home. The food was tasty and presented nicely. The service staff were excellent. Worth a visit if you are staying in the hotel
248,ChIJm_sdCNNc0i0RIJmaIzLcoJA,Kayuputi Restaurant,Jesse Vollmar,5,"Excellent experience. The food was incredible and I really enjoyed the way they mix the concept of a tasting menu and al la carte ordering. We didn't realize beforehand, but the brunch doesn't start until noon and can easily take several hours. They fill the time for earlier reservations by serving drinks as an apertif. It is worth going out of your way to enjoy this brunch."
249,ChIJm_sdCNNc0i0RIJmaIzLcoJA,Kayuputi Restaurant,Handoko Limaho,5,"This is one of THE MOST amazing place to eat in Bali. Even though the price is above average, but its worth every penny. The service is amazing, the food is great, the ambience is wonderful, and the view is breathtaking. We are really lucky to have its special brunch that is only served at weekends. We ate so many food from its wagyu, lobster, sashimi, and many varieties of dessert. This is truly one of the hotspot in Bali that you cannot miss."
250,ChIJm_sdCNNc0i0RIJmaIzLcoJA,Kayuputi Restaurant,Antique simon,5,"from the arrival experience to our departure the St.Regis team have certainly got this down to a fine art.
The cuisine and culinary offerings is what you would expect from a St.Regis and the flavors in the food they preparing in Bali is exquisite,making it unique.
The service associates are really on point at Kayuputi, ensuring nothing is left out during your brunch journey.
Thank you again for a making our occasion a memorable one indeed."
251,ChIJ33dBrSU90i0RLfghMTgPn_c,The Sayan House,c hindle,5,"Amazing! Wow.
Brilliant staff, all extremely friendly and welcoming. So polite.
The view is unreal, and almost warrants a 5 star review on its own. Make sure you get there during daylight hours so you can take it all in. Cocktails were lovely. The food was delightful, tacos were brilliant, so tasty. The teriyaki duck was delicious! Would definitely recommend a visit here! The staff then ordered us a taxi to get back to our hotel. 5*"
252,ChIJ33dBrSU90i0RLfghMTgPn_c,The Sayan House,Trish Flynn,5,"Beautiful setting overlooking a stunning valley. We popped in for a light lunch and were offered a seat at a counter overlooking 4 Seasons resort and a spectacular view. My husband ordered a hamburger and said it was the best one he'd ever had, praise indeed. I ordered the pork boa bun and the pork was succulent and the buns light and fluffy they were delicious. It started to rain and the staff sprung into action and took us up a level into their more upmarket restaurant where we were treated like honoured guests. This place was fantastic and I would highly recommend a visit."
253,ChIJ33dBrSU90i0RLfghMTgPn_c,The Sayan House,Cassie Reyes,4,"Placing a review after several visits to Sayan House. Food is expensive and portions are a bit small, still very tasty though! Make sense for price considering the location.

I do want to commend their staff for making the effort to make sure our Truffle fries were exactly how we wanted it because the past 3 times we went, the fries were cold.

Ambiance is great, and cocktails are really good too! Just make sure to book in advance if you want to catch the sunset."
254,ChIJ33dBrSU90i0RLfghMTgPn_c,The Sayan House,Celeste Booysen,3,"We went for the the beautiful view, but the bar area with the really beautiful view was closed, probably due to the overcast sky. They give you a table for a limited time, it seemed to be 2.5hours and I feel that any paying customer shouldn't be rushed. It's pricey for Bali, 150 000k/$10 per cocktail."
255,ChIJ33dBrSU90i0RLfghMTgPn_c,The Sayan House,Mary Walker,3,"Beautiful restaurant, great view, impeccable service, but sub-par food considering the price. We had the Chicken Nangam which tasted best, but pricey for only chicken (no sides or veg). The pork ribs were best value for money in terms of size. I would recommend this place for a romantic sunset drink."
256,ChIJTd5rcPY90i0Roq75vXLBX0s,Bali Moon Resto,Maria Mikolajek,5,"I had the best Gado Gado since I came to Bali.
The service was very good.
The view from my table was the best.
I can highly recommend to eat here.
I also had a nice mix juice and a very tasty Balinese coffee üòÄ"
257,ChIJTd5rcPY90i0Roq75vXLBX0s,Bali Moon Resto,Patra Boma,5,"The warung has now completely different menu and operates under the name of Men Jolin. It focuses on traditional Balinese food with very affordable local prices. The nyat-nyat chicken is on point and their jukut cantok and jukut bulung (seaweed) are tasty!

The young staffs are friendly and helpful. The restaurant accepts all kinds of e-payments."
258,ChIJTd5rcPY90i0Roq75vXLBX0s,Bali Moon Resto,Der Metzger (The Butcher),5,"In the reviews as usual only russians crying like babies. The food was awesome, cheap and tasty. See the picture of the steamed fish."
259,ChIJTd5rcPY90i0Roq75vXLBX0s,Bali Moon Resto,Sound Revolt,5,"My girlfriend and I have been having breakfast, lunch and dinner here for 4 or 5 months now. Everything is great üëçüèª"
260,ChIJTd5rcPY90i0Roq75vXLBX0s,Bali Moon Resto,Rick Goede,5,"We looked for dinner and found this special little restaurant where the road descents into a valley. The dining area has a nice view over the jungle below. We had chicken rendang, fuyonghai, pumpkin soup, and drinks. Everything was well-made and tasty. The staff was friendly and helpful."
261,ChIJJQRm22tH0i0Ri039M0Bg1yE,Nook,Sebelasdetik Saja,4,"Strategic location with typical Balinese view, rice paddies. Comfort seating and friendliest staff, helpful waiter, good üç∑wine quality, reasonable price, but then come to dishes it depends on what we order, our food was not so great, it‚Äôs served with cracked dried noodles, our fault is we order 2 each with different fishes, surprisingly it‚Äôs canned tuna and not fresh salmon. We expecting healthy and fresh dishes, so we can‚Äôt finished them. Nevertheless this place was good for just drink wine n chill, but not necessarily eating. Thank you üôè"
262,ChIJJQRm22tH0i0Ri039M0Bg1yE,Nook,s. mew,4,"Visit this place for the vibe. It‚Äôs beautiful and so serene. The food is alright, nothing to shout about. Although it does look pretty!

Good place to work at if you don‚Äôt mind being bugged by bugs that will come at you ever other minute. Being located next to paddy fields, some bugs were pretty huge.

Chairs could do with some cleaning but other than that we really enjoyed ourselves here! Wait staff were so accommodating and friendly too."
263,ChIJJQRm22tH0i0Ri039M0Bg1yE,Nook,Maharani,4,"Loving this place! The place is huge with semi outdoor seating areas & a view of paddy fields. They offer a wide array of dishes and drinks. Tried out the Crispy Fried Duck served with brown rice, Chicken Schnitzel with mushroom sauce, smoothie bowl & burger. All are done well and portion is huge. Also got the banana lassi and smoothie. They open early since breakfast and it really gets crowded. Really nice place to eat & hang out."
264,ChIJJQRm22tH0i0Ri039M0Bg1yE,Nook,Filistian 23,5,"Love the place, love the food, love the ambiance.
The food prices are slightly higher range but worth the price.
Especially egg Benedict and avocado toast.
Big portions, generous amount of salads.
Taste clean and fresh.
And with rice fields view in front of you
It makes everything better.
I always visit Nook everytime I go to Bali."
265,ChIJJQRm22tH0i0Ri039M0Bg1yE,Nook,Purnama,4,"This is one of my favorite lunch spots in Seminyak. I frequently visited this restaurant.
With a view of rice field the restaurant atmosphere is really attractive.
Last time I went, the sangria was 30% off, which was a good price and tasted great

My favorite dishes here were the prawn spaghetti.

I wish the staff were friendlier."
266,ChIJJR9--cr10S0R-jkErGbhQ2w,The Amora Bali,Joanna Low,5,"My driver/guide at Bali introduced this place to us and I‚Äôve got to say it‚Äôs worth the visit.

The dining area is facing Mount Batur and the view is magnificent üòç quite a lot of food options here and it‚Äôs buffet style, so you get to eat as much as you like :)

Service here is good and the staff are friendly.

Would definitely recommend to try this place out if you ever pass by it üëçüèªü§©‚õ∞Ô∏è"
267,ChIJJR9--cr10S0R-jkErGbhQ2w,The Amora Bali,Shreya Gupta,5,"Beautiful view and descent price!
The price of the food is so decent given the great service and beautiful ambience. The waitress kindly took photos for us. I had the fish and it tasted extremely fresh. It‚Äôs honestly one of the most beautiful lunches I‚Äôve ever had! Really recommend!"
268,ChIJJR9--cr10S0R-jkErGbhQ2w,The Amora Bali,Kimberly,5,"My guide took me to eat here, the food was decent, especially the dessert. The price is the same with other similar restaurants in touristy place, they have a la carte option too and it actually looks really nice. The view was amazing and their service was incredibly friendly. It's kinda hard to find decent place to eat around here and for me hygiene is very important (I don't want to get stomachache while traveling). It has been days since I ate here and there isn't any problem. In conclusion, I personally think this place is not bad."
269,ChIJJR9--cr10S0R-jkErGbhQ2w,The Amora Bali,Roystan Pereira,5,"The landscape of this spectacular restaurant is just hard to put it in words. You can see the lake, mountain & the scenic landscape. The restaurant offers variety of cuisine with Balinese, indian & other specialities. Lastly the hospitality is just top notch here. Ideal place to get a cool pic here :)"
270,ChIJJR9--cr10S0R-jkErGbhQ2w,The Amora Bali,Annie Nugraha,4,"I was lucky to be here with family.  We've captured gorgeous pictures as a great memories at the last week of 2021.  The best ones indeed.

Meals and drinks were also great.  Especially Kintamani Citrus.  One of the most refreshing drink I've tasted so far.  And of course the thin Signature Amora Pizza.  Tasty and rich of flavor.  Don't forget to try whilst you're here.

Staffs were also welcome, friendly and move efficiently.

Thanks The AMORA BALI. I will certainly return for my next trips to Bali."

273,ChIJnR2CHVMn0i0RTMiLHPH3cfU,Samiya Restaurant,Calvin Voon,4,"An above average restaurant with a GORGEOUS view. Makes for a great stopover for lunch or an afternoon drink/tea on the way to Bedugul.

Nestled inside the Royal Tulip Resorts, there are plenty of parking spaces.

Food was ok. Probably didn‚Äôt order enough to really comment on its overall quality. Had a salad and an Indonesia dish with fish and rice.

Drinks were ok. Had the Beauty La Femme, which sounded promising but tasted more like cough syrup. Wouldn‚Äôt order that again but will definitely be back to try other items from the menus."
274,ChIJnR2CHVMn0i0RTMiLHPH3cfU,Samiya Restaurant,Advantours,5,"On the way to Bedugul early in the morning, I was wondering where to have breakfast. Was thinking to go to one of the hotel at Pacung already when I saw this beautiful hotel, Golden Tulip. Buffet Breakfast cost 150k nett per person which is a very good value for what they offered. Giant long tables were packed of great dishes from East to West, hot and cold. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. The view is breathtaking. Will try to stay there next time."
275,ChIJnR2CHVMn0i0RTMiLHPH3cfU,Samiya Restaurant,Lee Cook,5,"Fantastic food, friendly staff. Definitely worthy of 5 stars. Prices are higher than average, as you would expect from such a classy place, but not extravagant - the meal (for two) in my photo was 170k. I've spent more than that for less many times in Bali.
Make sure you visit!

Pro tip to all the 1-star reviewers: if you want great food stay off the Western menu! You're in Bali, indulge in the delicious Balinese cuisine!"
276,ChIJDwSD1V9H0i0RJmcyC7pyQM8,Jaansan Bali Restaurant,James,4,I went in there late at night &they stayed open to serve me which was really nice of them. The food was fresh and cooked well full of traditional Balinese flavours. Good value for money!
277,ChIJDwSD1V9H0i0RJmcyC7pyQM8,Jaansan Bali Restaurant,Jordan Lee,1,"Travelled to try this restaurant due to high ratings and reviews but ended up with disappointment experience. Bought seafood basket and live clams as well as seafood fried rice, the grilled king prawn stated in the seafood basket doesn‚Äôt tasted to be fresh and big enough. Apparently the prawn in the fried rice is nicer. The clams weren‚Äôt fresh at all it tasted sour and bad. The crab were burnt as well shown in our picture and lastly, there are hair in their chilli sauce. Overall not worth to try and there are better seafood places for sure! :)"
278,ChIJDwSD1V9H0i0RJmcyC7pyQM8,Jaansan Bali Restaurant,Eric Frank,5,My wife and I loved this place! The crispy duck and the fresh fish were awesome. The staff was extremely attentive and kind and the owner was extremely friendly. He also makes great honeymoon cocktails! I recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Bali.!
279,ChIJDwSD1V9H0i0RJmcyC7pyQM8,Jaansan Bali Restaurant,Bali Damai,5,"Went here with family and tried many seafood and some tradisional balinese. Wow the portion are big, they were very honest with Quality ang quantity. Taste so good, very fresh, well prepared and cooked. Thank for such beautiful meals were all so happy. Great service and place."
280,ChIJDwSD1V9H0i0RJmcyC7pyQM8,Jaansan Bali Restaurant,Pete Klimek,5,"Possibly the very best meals we have had in Bali. Probably the friendliest service. Definitely a must-visit restaurant when you are in Bali. The seafood and rijstafel are their signature dishes, but we opted for local Indonesian dishes and were really satisfied with the quality and quantity of our meals!"
281,ChIJk0rRixJH0i0RLUg5-J_2IEE,Merah Putih,Ming L,5,My colleague suggested Merah Putih to me before I made a trip there. We decided to reserve a table for 9 people and asked to be seated on the mezzanine floor. We were thrilled to receive such a nice table. Foods are excellent but naturally on the pricey side. The waitresses were attentive the entire evening. Check out this restaurant if you're looking for a fine Indonesian dining in Bali. You won't regret it; wonderful encounter!
282,ChIJk0rRixJH0i0RLUg5-J_2IEE,Merah Putih,Anya C,5,"Amazing Indonesian fine dining. Excellent service and beautiful ambience too. Wish I had more space in my stomach to try more dishes. They also have a tasting menu and cocktail tasting flight, which I will need to try another time! 10/10 would recommend and go again. Pricier than the average restaurant but well worth it"
283,ChIJk0rRixJH0i0RLUg5-J_2IEE,Merah Putih,Gaurav Deep Singh,5,Food was excellent and well cooked. Ambience was nice and service was great. Would 100% recommend to anyone who wants a little more fancy than usual Indonesian food with some class. Price is a bit more than the usual restaurant but the flavours warrant it - I think it‚Äôs very worth it for this price range.
284,ChIJk0rRixJH0i0RLUg5-J_2IEE,Merah Putih,Dimas Erlangga,5,"It's worth it for those who want to try Indonesian fine dining experiences. The price is more expensive than  a local restaurant in Bali however it's totally worth it, worth it. The food presentation was excellent and despite their price the taste was awesome. The other thing that makes me give 5 stars to Merah Putih is their architectures, it looks so elegant. It's a perfect place for a usual dinner or date.

The staff are also nice and friendly and their service is excellent. Two thumbs up for them."
285,ChIJk0rRixJH0i0RLUg5-J_2IEE,Merah Putih,Ned Lidbury,5,"Honesty one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Bali. The service was great, the food was incredible, the cocktails made everywhere else seem amateurish... Make sure you book, because it seems word is out about this place and it was absolutely packed. Highly recommended!"

The level of service and the quality of food is what you expect from such a quality venue but the night was made by Dika, who looked after us all night.

Dika is an absolute credit to your hotel and I would love for the thanks and praise again to be passed on.  We wish you the best in your studies, you will go far in hospitality with your positive attitude and beautiful demeanor.

The food quality and taste was sensational,  traditional Balinese menu was promised and it delivered.  Highly recommended."

The dinner with a variety of food options was amazing! I really recommend it as an unforgettable culinary experience!"
303,ChIJySXvVVc90i0RdOkVA_NwHEo,CasCades Restaurant,Asaad Albaloshi,5,"The attentiveness of the staff serving you can be immediately noticed. Their friendliness is the island high standard, as expected.

If it‚Äôs not too sunny, go for the tables at the periphery for meals with a view. I‚Äôve found 7am for breakfast to be unrivaled and very picturesque (instagramable for the Millennials and Gen-Zs)."
304,ChIJySXvVVc90i0RdOkVA_NwHEo,CasCades Restaurant,David Chai,3,"Food quality is range from good (the grill fish, Pumpkin salad), average (tuna tartare, grill chicken), some is tasteless (eg paella is leak of seasoning-salt) and some are chewy (grill octopus).

Service is good for some of the staffs but bad for some (eg service food without explanation on what sauce they serving, trying to remove the plate when we yet finish our dish, water drip in to our food when pouring wine, serving our soup without spoon).

This really doesn‚Äôt match the price it charging, and really need improvement on both food and service area.

Overall
Food- 3.2/5
Service- 3/5
Environment- 3/5 (was not inform this is alfresco dinning)
Location- 4/5 (15 mins drive from Ubud Center)"
305,ChIJySXvVVc90i0RdOkVA_NwHEo,CasCades Restaurant,Masasina,5,"Romantic and special

We regularly go on the dates with my husband and choosing romantic or unique experiences. So this time we arrived to the candle-light dinner by the pool and the jungle valley view before sunset.

Fine-dining experience went beyond expectations, although i thought I‚Äôd like to come back here for brung and pool-time with my friends(the pool is not crowded like in most popular places in Ubud).

Service was amazing, knowledgeable about the dishes ingredients and good balance of talking and giving us a quite romantic time. Food and drinks suited both my European tongue and my Balinese husband preferences for local food. Grilled octopus and pan seared barramundi were delicious, highly recommended. I cannot drink alcohol now, so we had good-quality black tea there with chocolate fondant. Wine-list is quite extensive though.

Highly recommended for romantic dinners as well as for swimming pool time withought crows around you."

311,ChIJ_Q5n311A0i0R4yKG_eF9H3I,The Restaurant at The Legian Seminyak,Eran,3,"The restaurant offers a very pleasant experience at their terrace overlooking the sea. The staff and service is excellent. The food is good, but cannot compete with other fine dining experiences. Additionally the restaurant is expensive even when compared with establishments in Europe; two courses and a glas of wine for two persons was IDR 1.600K (EUR 107).

All in all the food and service is good. Taking the price and food into account it falls short of fine dining experiences elsewhere."
312,ChIJ_Q5n311A0i0R4yKG_eF9H3I,The Restaurant at The Legian Seminyak,Mani,5,"We have frequented this restaurant for years during our Bali trips and still has remained as one of our favourite restaurants for the cuisine, ambience, service and the views. Would recommend going for lunch as it offers sublime ocean views, generally quieter and the service is impeccable.

The dishes does take time to prepare as they make everything upon order and that has been ok for us to enjoy the ambience and the views from the restaurant and the dishes has always been special and well worth the wait. Cuisine wise it's nothing out of the norm or special, you find your regular Indonesian/western dishes but what makes it special is the care they put on the dish, displayed in preparation, ingredients and the quality of the dish. Nasi goreng I tried is one of my favourites and Bubur ayam was one of our other local delights.

Reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant and I find this as a great way to enjoy Legian service and ambience even on a dining visit.

Special mention to the impeccable service by the staff, very well trained and a great showcase of how they can stand apart in service standards."

Place is clean and spacious, suitable for big groups. People are very friendly and helpful here. For the price, well its a bit higher than the usual padang restaurant but its kinda worth it i think. Ask for the 'all serve' kinda thing they do where they will put lots and lots of different plates with different √©ntree on the table and you get to choose whatever you like and pay for what you eat only.

I know this restaurant from my college friend who is originally from Padang and lives in Bukit Tinggi, he once talked to the owner & it turns out that the owner is originally from Padang. The place is standard like Padang Pads restaurants in general.

As for the food, I tried rendang for the first time, it tasted okay but it's still better than the ISI side in my opinion. Meanwhile, the grilled fish tastes great! The seasoning is delicious & tastes authentic, between the tuna, tilapia and mackerel, I highly recommend the mackerel, and what I like the most here is Cincang, whose broth is so rich in spices! I've been to several well-known Padang restaurants in Jakarta but the minced meat is not as good as here.

The price is affordable, all rice + side dishes cost 15 thousand (except for some menus such as egg rice which is only 7 thousand-10 thousand), the portions are quite large like at RM Padang in general. Overall highly recommended!"

The portion is filling, even if you want to add rice, that's okay because the father offered to add rice or not hehe.
You can take it home or eat on the spot, the stalls are clean and tidy, the food is fresh. It's very cheap, rice and vegetable side dishes are only Rp. 10,000 except for side dishes of rendang and tilapia above 10k. Open from 9am to 9pm.

483,ChIJj27j13EWei4RgvKQEeA1E5E,Anda Masakan Padang,Ayu Mitha Radila,5,"The most consistent Padang cuisine in Solo. The rendang and seasonings are dry, not wet like the usual fields in Solo. The filling of the rice rames is complete and interesting: aubergine sauce, cassava leaves and klengkam.

Have a menu that you can't buy online because the stock is low: fried skin that is savory and delicious for my size, who is very picky with processed skins.

The fish head curry is really good. It's been to Simple which is expensive but the curry in you is still the best.

The jerky is also very delicious. I can probably order here 10 times a month and have never been disappointed. The price is relatively cheap for a price as good as this, 2 people spend 50-60k with iced tea."
484,ChIJj27j13EWei4RgvKQEeA1E5E,Anda Masakan Padang,pezz0novante,5,"Unique and authentic!

I can recommend this place through word of mouth, everyone says that this is one of the authentic and anti-mainstream Warung Nasi Padang.

Unlike Nasi Padang in general, here they use potato chips and eggplant balado instead of jackfruit.
Try not to oversleep when you eat here, because the mainstay dishes: Beef Rendang and Spiced Fried Skin can sometimes be used up in less than 2 hours.

Where other Padang RMs try to suit the tongue of Solo residents who quite like sweets, here instead it emphasizes the savory, medok taste and the spicy blend of the red and green chili sauce.

The typical rendang is not too wet, the spices seep into the meat and are quite soft. I recommend this very limited spice fried skin not to be used as a snack, the seasoning which is quite strong and quite salty will be just right if eaten with the rames rice.

""you"" is really comforting."
485,ChIJj27j13EWei4RgvKQEeA1E5E,Anda Masakan Padang,Avagail Natasha,5,"RM. Your Padang is my favorite since childhood. When I returned to Solo again and tried it, the taste didn't change. Still delicious and authentic padang. Complete menu, lots of choices. What I like the most is the vegetable rice, complete with eggplant balado and cassava leaves. The most favorite is the balado snapper tail. Food is not salty. It's really balanced. Make a portion of the meal wrapped in take home/takeaway or eat on the spot, both are filling. The white rice is also delicious. It's also available on ShopeeFood and other food ordering applications. If you want Nasi Padang to go to Solo, this is what I recommend!"

521,ChIJbz6wkCoUei4RITYAD9tL1gA,Rumah Makan Minang Saiyo,AB,2,"I really like it, the first one is grilled chicken breast, cassava leaves, jackfruit vegetables, chili sauce, the taste is really good, the seasoning is really good, I just moved from Jakarta to Solo, from several Padang rms in Solo that I have tried, my choice went to Minang Saiyo's rm , because the taste is almost the same, the taste is delicious, the same as in Jakarta, BUT these 3 months the taste has changed, the spice smell is still strong, but the taste is bland, the grilled chicken only has flour, no more choices, the jackfruit is also not available, so what I have is You can only get it, grilled chicken with flour, cassava leaves, and green chili sauce, only 1 spoon of the broth is given, it's not like the first time I bought it, there are 3-4 kinds of sauce and seasonings which are taro and poured over rice so it tastes right it's really great... many say maybe it's not the time yet...? complete set at 12 - 1 o'clock...hopefully we can go back to how it used to be, for the taste, and the presentation of the spices and the broth which is not stingy...because I've been hoping to find rm padang that suits my tongue in the city of Solo, sorry for the 2 stars already, da, later when it's back like it used to be again I'll give it 10 stars then..."

This restaurant is quite well-known in Indonesia and in several neighboring countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Australia, and is liked by various groups from various ethnicities and nations. This is due to its delicious cooking and adaptability that can adjust to the tongue or tastes of the people where this restaurant is located. Padang restaurants outside West Sumatra serve dishes that are not too spicy, in contrast to restaurants in their own homeland."

Roadside location so it's easy to park the car. Friendly and satisfying service. Clean place .

539,ChIJxwxMBR2J2TERsaeky0GlDBo,Sei Enam Seafood Batam Centre,Patricia Fan,4,"Chillicrab and black pepper crab were flavorful and saucy which went well with fried buns though the size of chillicrab were small (300-400g) and pincers also quite small and a bit tough on the meat.

Cereal prawn were fresh though not really coated much with the cereal flakes.

Service staff had difficulty in understanding our questions hence have to rely on the supervisor whenever we need anything.

The place were empty on weekday nights.

Overall recommended to try out their  crab and crayfish."

Excellent service.
Spent S$83 for 2 pax on a crab, a steamed fish, an order of vege, squid, 2 mantous, 1 plate of rice and a glass of fruit juice."

Don't let the outside and surroundings fool you.

As for the food, they mainly serve western type food with various types of beverages. It's a bit pricey, but the services and the whole atmosphere makes up for it.

Overall, it's a really cool place to hang out with your friends and family with great atmosphere.

Forgot to mention they have live music during the night. The live music starts at 8 PM-12 AM."

And the most amazing when I saw the bill I could not give credit to what I was seeing, 300.000 ID rupiees (30 SGD, 20 USD) for 3 persons dinner. absolutely worth it."

549,ChIJi1-sZA-J2TERfafMTF2dOdU,Love Seafood Batam Centre,Wendy Tan,2,"Food served was fast but freshness and food quality was below expectation. The oyster were miserable small with thick shell and has not much taste. Most of the selection on the menu were unavailable on a Saturday afternoon due to no stock and there was basically only 1 table of customers only before us. It was quite disappointing to know that there was no crayfish, clams, gonggong and that the prawns served were not fresh and taste was really below standard. As compared to my visit to their batam center outlet before pre covid, the standard has dropped alot. Will give this place a miss for my next trip."
550,ChIJi1-sZA-J2TERfafMTF2dOdU,Love Seafood Batam Centre,Sa Rah,1,"Overrated.
Fried chicken and fried rice are ok.
Seafood is simple and so-so.
Service is horrible. Many staff walking around but very hard to get their attention. Always looking around even when talking to you or taking your order. Food came very slowly. Missed our orders even after reminding 5 times to 3 different people. Certainly will not recommend."

- scallop was totally not fresh with sand inside
- liked the fish and bitter gourd"

It is clean, nicely decorated and has both inside and outside seatings. The food is authentically Indonesian and delicious with reasonable price.

Personally i like it for its cleanness and spaciousness. The food itself it‚Äôs not overly too salty or spicy. Even though the sauce is spicy, we can usually get it separated so we can have it accordingly to our liking."
555,ChIJa2VYPoqJ2TER0LVKAOdhVgU,Restoran Pondok Batam Kuring,Melvin Lin,5,"Good food, reasonable prices, friendly people, and interesting set-up. Pretty much checks all the boxes.

There are the traditional kinds of tables and chairs, and also other tables where you could sit on the ground in a semi-private kind of area. They also have an interesting way for customers to get the attention of the service staff, and the children found that entertaining

The only drawback was there are mosquitoes - do bring insect repellant."
556,ChIJa2VYPoqJ2TER0LVKAOdhVgU,Restoran Pondok Batam Kuring,Adam Ismail,5,"Love all the dishes we ate here.

We had grilled gurame, sotong tepung, ayam goreng garlic, terong berlado, tauge ikan asin n empal goreng. 5 pax, nearly 600k rupiah.. Hmmm.. All these restaurants famous among tourists seem to be between 500-600k rupiah.

We arrived b4 Maghrib n got to see the place in daylight. By the time we finished eating it was night time n got to see the place lighted up! Both scenes gave different vibes.

Tips: services can be slow. Don't come when you're super hungry! üòú"

564,ChIJ7fKCz3KR2TERialSDhhc4Eg,Kopak Jaya 007 Kelong Seafood Batam,Sherab Tenzin,4,"When we visited Barelang bridge, we stopped here for a lunch. It's a seashore stilt house or  a Kelong restaurant which serves fresh and delicious seafoods straight from their sea farms.

The view is nice. While waiting for orders, we had fresh juices and then took photos with scenic backgrounds.

Its seaside location, and cool wind altogether make it a wonderful family or group dining experiences place. They also play local and English songs.

Prices are reasonable given the generous size and excellent quality. The only thing is no staff speaks English and it was bit difficult for us making orders.

Overall, we had wonderful experience. Though it's far from core Batam and not being that popular, it would be worth visiting at least once."
565,ChIJ7fKCz3KR2TERialSDhhc4Eg,Kopak Jaya 007 Kelong Seafood Batam,Sharon Wee,5,"Great dinner and great environment. The food was good but not the crab. Probably is better to order fish instead.

2. Veg - nice
3. Crayfish with salted egg - nice
4. Egg with onions - nice"

The mini lobster, the prawn, the fish, everything‚Äôs just super delicious. My favourite is the spicy calamari ring and the original mini lobster. Super delicious! The mozzarella mini lobster also so creamy and tasty but it was just too heavy to had as a seafood. Everything‚Äôs just perfecto üëåüèª"
567,ChIJ7fKCz3KR2TERialSDhhc4Eg,Kopak Jaya 007 Kelong Seafood Batam,Arthur Toh,5,"Although about an hour's drive town but it's worth the drive. Restaurant is by the sea near Harris Hotel. You pick/choose your fish, prawn & gonggong from the nets that the staff help bring up from the 'nets in the sea'. Then your food is well prepared and served. Prices are reasonable so so much cheaper than a seafood meal here in Singapore. While you wait to be served enjoy the breeze and cool atmosphere. Can't wait to return."

582,ChIJQ3MF1RyJ2TERxf9SKx9KgxQ,Freshbeer Batam Centre,Nathaniel L,5,"Decided to take a ferry to Batam just to look for this place after reading about it online for its exotic menu available. (Don't worry, there are 'normal' food selections too for everyone)

Took a 15mins cab ride from Harbour Bay terminal as I wasnt confident of finding it as it's not along the main road.

Started with the green beer. Taste wise, domestic lager. But I am not there for that. It quenches and has the ABV so no complains here.

Jumped in with Crocodile, had it goreng (fried) and had the snake meat cooked with black pepper.

LOVED both. The black pepper was so aromatic. The fried sliced croc made perfect bar bites with beer.

Portion wasnt too big so I could order the Biawak (Monitor Lizard) which is only served Goreng style. It comes on bone so dig in with your hands and dip it in the spicy sweet black sauce. Meat has a natural sweetness to it. This has to be my fav dish of the 3.

They have taken bat off the menu so that was a slight disappointment. But hey, still a strong exotic offering.

Very friendly female staff who tended to me. Will be back again to try other food!"

605,ChIJ8bAttjqJ2TERB_4M8NjFIrU,Kez's Bakery & Restaurant,Jo,5,"I really love this place. It's a 2 floor restaurant. It's so quiet, so calm, it's a good place to work, to read and to study (not when kids are around). I never been to the second floor but the first one is good enough for me, they may serve wine on the second floor as it is a fine dining restaurant too.
The range of food is good, the bread is super delicious (you may ask or they'll offer you to warm the bread if you plan to dine in). The beverages is great! This place is amazing! Good food, drinks, ambience, service and all! üíï

PS: if you come with a group, ask them for a toys for you to kill time while waiting for the food because they provide some üòâ"

611,ChIJHwZpoIiJ2TERpzwO97_Rr3A,Amare Ristorante Italiano,Mariah Boon,5,Wish we discovered this way back. Feels like we've been missing out after all of these years going to Batam and not knowing this place existed üòÖ The food is great! Mushroom soup tasted unique and flavourful. Lasagna is the best ever it really satisfied our cravings. The Calzone is loaded with meat. Overall a great experience with the owner and staff being super friendly.
612,ChIJHwZpoIiJ2TERpzwO97_Rr3A,Amare Ristorante Italiano,Flo Yeow,4,"They're probably one of the more authentic Italian restaurants here in Batam. It's near some of the shopping malls, if you're visiting Batam for the weekend, it's easy to just swing by. Food quality ain't anything too fancy, but they work.

Was honestly quite surprised when a few tables of westerners walked in for dinner later in the evening. Pizzas, pastas, salad. Go for the usual items and you can't get too wrong with your choices."
613,ChIJHwZpoIiJ2TERpzwO97_Rr3A,Amare Ristorante Italiano,Candy Lee (cyanedel),5,"Attention to dear fellow commoners. Their price tag is a bit high here. Make sure you are prepared to dig your wallet a bit deeper.

Nice and cozy place to dine. The waiters are really friendly here. This can be plus points if you love to connect with others. But can be a minus points for people like me who just want to dine in peace without keep getting asked about the food.

They also have special menu - (not sure if it is on daily or weekly basis) - and on weekends. which is a really good reason for you to keep checking them out and try them.

Ordered pizza (which I forgot the name) and roasted porchetta here. Loved the pizza but not really into the porchetta. The dish itself is quite good but somehow doesn't feel special.

Vegetarian menu is available here, pork related dish is also labelled well. But If you're super picky about ""contamination"" (by meat or pork related food) then this place might not very well suited for you."
614,ChIJHwZpoIiJ2TERpzwO97_Rr3A,Amare Ristorante Italiano,Veronica Him,4,"Overall, a pleasant dining experience. Service was excellent as staffs were friendly and helpful. Food was good, with fresh ingredients and freshly prepared. However, not everything is mind-blowing, as the sauces taste more dominant than the dish itself. But I would still recommend this place to those looking for non-halal Italian food, as it‚Äôs hard to find an Italian restaurant in Batam that serves Pork dishes. If u want to bring your dog, there is outdoor seating available.

Prosciutto Pizza üåü; 4.5/5 Umami. U can taste a combination of sweet and salty flavors. The crust was crispy.

Roasted Porchetta üåü; 4/5 Tender, juicy, crispy and less oily.

Ravioli Chilli Crab üåü; 3.5/5 Dumpling was good. But I barely taste the chili crab sauce.

Fettuccine Truffle Norcina üåü; 3/5 Pasta was al dente, but a bit bland and dry. Could have done more seasoning."
615,ChIJHwZpoIiJ2TERpzwO97_Rr3A,Amare Ristorante Italiano,Cherry Mcloughlin,5,This is our favorite Italian restaurant when In Batam. The Food are Freshly made By Chef Marco. Pizzas are very good as well as the pasta dishes. Good ambiance and very friendly staff.

617,ChIJmdh9vgOJ2TER4ig0EP5RXEo,Sanur Restaurant & Catering,M Shahril,2,"Restaurant looked promising but when we entered, the dining area was dark and aircon too warm. Waitress was not friendly and I can tell not trained to serve. We asked for the light to be switched on but was told ""tidak boleh"" or cannot. Soup buntut came and we were totally disappointed. Tasted like water with salt with oxtail thrown in. I returned that abomination and my wife requested to change to sambal ox tail. To my horror when the dish came, my first bite was cold like it came out from the fridge.. oh my god. Terong belacan was not fully cooked and semi hard. Gurame Bakar was good - u can't go too wrong with grilled fish. Well here I am trying to finish the food in a sauna. We got a refund for the oxtail and the staff later listened to our feedback and opologised. Hopefully they do a better job next time."

621,ChIJR7937EmJ2TERjJjROQExx9k,Piccola Stella,FoodieDirectory,5,I enjoyed the food here. Burger bun was so buttery. Beef patty is like home made and juicy. Even the soup tastes like it‚Äôs done from scratch. It‚Äôs a nice find. A bit out of the way from the usual spots. I like how they do up the decor and exterior to make it look like an Italian villa.
622,ChIJR7937EmJ2TERjJjROQExx9k,Piccola Stella,Rita,5,Enjoyed our dinner here. Portion of food really good. We ordered quite alot still we manage to finished it all. Really recommended.

Bad service, need to keep reminding them the order although orders were printed.

Can‚Äôt really absorb, the shop packed with Diners but to me personally, my hometown hawker centre prepared way better fried rice.

Sorry, it‚Äôs just an honest review.

We ordered
Nasi Goreng Komplit x3, Sate x1, x3 Mie Terempa, x1 Nasi Goreng Kampung, x1 gorengan,x1 gado2, x3 Mie Ayam, x10 Luti Gendang.

I guessed it‚Äôs just the hype, rumours saying this is the best. Mehhhhhh.

To the Management,
Kindly segregate smokers from other Diners, create an area where you can allow smoking while eating, eating while smoking, what have you. There are kids and elderly, be considerate."
627,ChIJpb6XWieJ2TERNe1K2kVkws0,Mie Terempa'K,Jojo Cambel,5,"Simple, tasty and authentic.  A must try if you are in Batam.  The prices are very reasonable.  If second hand smoke does not bother you, that's the only drawback."
628,ChIJpb6XWieJ2TERNe1K2kVkws0,Mie Terempa'K,Elsa Mustikawati,5,"Mie Tarempa is a delicious local dish from around Kepulauan Riau. The sauce taste so flavorful with sweet and slightly sour taste. It also taste a bit savory from the dried fish (or so). A must try when visiting Batam!

Also don‚Äôt forget to order Luti Gendang as well üôÇ"
629,ChIJpb6XWieJ2TERNe1K2kVkws0,Mie Terempa'K,Dennis N,5,"Must try the Luti Gendang and mie goreng komplit. Simple yet deliciously well made!

The Nasi Dagang is also fragrant and on point. One of the places that I will definitely be coming back again for!"
630,ChIJpb6XWieJ2TERNe1K2kVkws0,Mie Terempa'K,Amanda Lee,5,"We stopped here for a quick lunch before returning to Singapore, and it was definitely worth the visit. They have 3 outlets but we went to the one closest to Batam Center.

We ordered the thicker noodles 'mie goreng' style, as well as the dry bihun and a 'moist' version of kwayteow - you can order your noodles in 'dry/moist/wet' options. At around 20,000 IDR per plate which came heaped with noodles, we found it extremely value for money, and even ordered an extra plate of noodles to share to try a new flavour.

There was a slight wokhey taste to the mie which made it extremely flavourful.

Do note that the staff do not speak English, but we made use of Google translate to communicate and place our orders."
631,ChIJv2nkBB2J2TERA5sawzYBWd4,Ikan Bakar Cianjur - Batam,Alex Issokson,5,"The food here was incredible! My favorites were the fried chicken, fried fish (I think was catfish), and the spinach. They were all fried and cooked perfectly and had tons of flavor. I'm not used to cutting fish off the bone, but here it was pretty easy too. It was nice eating with the rice and some of then sauce. The fruit was kinda boring though."
632,ChIJv2nkBB2J2TERA5sawzYBWd4,Ikan Bakar Cianjur - Batam,Irwan Junardi,5,"Good quality and taste of the food, if you dunno where to get your meal, just come here and it will never fails, my fave is nasi liwet and avocado juice."
633,ChIJv2nkBB2J2TERA5sawzYBWd4,Ikan Bakar Cianjur - Batam,Kathleen Lok,5,Nasi Leput is delicious. We loved their nasi goreng java too. Sambal is not spicy and it's free flow. Sedap!

Best service. I got tea and sugar added already, however they immediately exchange it for me without any question. Thanks and good place for next visit."
635,ChIJv2nkBB2J2TERA5sawzYBWd4,Ikan Bakar Cianjur - Batam,Melvin Lim,4,The Nasi liwet was still highly recommended compare to the other dishes. The saut√© kailan was very oily. Overall it was a good meal.

641,ChIJ3TWkKCiK2TERwYTUTBdGRX8,Sup Ikan Yong Kee,S A,3,Fish soup is fresh and texture very smooth. It has a little bit of fishy taste. Prawns fresh too but sauce taste is quite normal although spicy. Service is very slow for the food to be served.
642,ChIJ3TWkKCiK2TERwYTUTBdGRX8,Sup Ikan Yong Kee,Alvin Toh,4,"A decent place for dining, service is prompt and some staff do speak Chinese. Ingredients are fresh but the price is slightly on the high side. I do like their soup of the fish soup, it‚Äôs light but yet tasty. Don‚Äôt really like the fish as I think they do process meat. Do try their petai with fried Ikan bilis and garlic fried chicken, it‚Äôs yummy!"
643,ChIJ3TWkKCiK2TERwYTUTBdGRX8,Sup Ikan Yong Kee,Yee Chong P,4,"Fish soup is clear and clean-tasting, not too fishy or salty. I would preferred if you could choose the type of fish, but it seems like there is only 1 standard type.

Funny thing is the other Love Seafood place at Batam centre is nowhere as delicious as this establishment. It takes almost one hour to get there from Nagoya but well worth it.
Come early to avoid large crowds.

Myself top up sotong and gong gong. Personally surprised with the gong gong taste, unexpected nice taste, match well with the source, and like the chunchy feel. I believe this should be a must try for me if i come again. Price is still reasonable for me, attached my order for reference. Even, is a open space area and a bit smoky when they burn the fish, still the environment is not hot during my visit. I choose like what the others does, sit outdoor."

Unfortunately they were closed, and our hired driver brought us here as a substitute. At the end of dinner, I would have rather he brought us to McDonald's instead.

Service was slow. There was nobody to greet us at the door, so we sat ourselves down at a table (they were only about 30% full on a Saturday night). It took our driver a full 15 minutes to locate someone who could bring us the menu.

Following that, it was another 15 minutes before someone came to take our orders.

It then took another 30 minutes for the food and drinks to be served. Yes, for some reason they could not even serve drinks first.

The food tasted mass-produced. We were not impressed. We were also not impressed when it was time for the bill."

679,ChIJaUcoftaJ2TEREhiFISdW9XY,EDEN Restaurant,Berenice Ting,5,"Probably the only fine dining restaurant in Batam.

Google recommended this place to me when I was searching for a chi-chi place to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary. This place did not disappoint in terms of the taste, quality, service and atmosphere. Although it is fine dining but the experience was very intimate and cozy and definitely not intimidating. I learnt that the chef-owner gave up being an aspiring neurosurgeon to pursue his passion in culinary and his girlfriend, Felicia, whom is the hostess of the place gave up being a lawyer to help him in this journey. The best job one could ever find is pursuing his dream as an occupation.

If you‚Äôre ever in Batam, do give this place a try for a different yet amazing experience. Felicia is very fluent in English and takes time to explain every item that is going in to your mouth. A very sweet young lady who answers everything you are curious about this establishment.

For IDR855K per pax, you‚Äôre getting a steal for the entire gastronomy experience and a satisfied bursting belly!"

The second was kimchi, seaweed and mussels. Ordered a burrata cheese too. For mains, had shrimp pasta, duck breast and beef. Desserts was Earl Grey panna cotta and Apple crumble.

The price point is reasonable given the quality of the food. Each plate is carefully crafted by Chef Dave with thoughtful attention to detail. Felicia provides detailed explanations on every dish and attentive service.

One bone to pick is the Mapo Tofu Udon which was a Sour & Hot soup (ÈÖ∏Ëæ£Ê±§)."

The service is also good. maybe the drawback is that there is no motorbike parking space. Or is it just me who can't find it? Not everyone who eats into sushi tei is a car person."
685,ChIJA8xzCH6J2TERupL4fa1sukM,Sushi Tei,RL Chu,1,"Mediocre food. I ordered sashimi (tuna belly, salmon, swordfish and tuna), it wasn't fresh. My friend and I got diarrhea for the next 2 days after eating. The sashimi tastes slimy and sticky.
The rest of the food was equally bad, the mentaiko had too much mayo than the taste of the roe. The soba noodles were overcooked.
The menu said tempura nori was good but it didn't suit our taste pallette, it's also not a typical item in an authentic Japanese restaurant.
The only good thing is their drinks, we got ocha and orange black tea.
Lastly, the price wasn't friendly. Food wasn't worth the price we paid."
686,ChIJN2cren2J2TERNNBNU3CbV_Y,Restaurant Nature Vegetarian,Nona Hitam Pahit (Elnie),5,This wasn‚Äôt our first time to be here. The food are vegetarian but well served with good quality food.

Took as 5mins only to reach their place. BTW we stay at Nagoya mansion hotel cheap Ma.... hahaha. We spend about sin$100 only for 6 of us.

- Black pepper Crab came missing 4 of the legs, feedback and they gave us a new plate of crab :). Taste wise black pepper is good. Crab meat slightly mushy but still fresh.
- Salted egg sotong was pretty good.
- Fried egg with onion is normal.

Got no choice as we were there during peak period, CNY to be exact.

Menus provided without prices, highlighted to the waiter and they said can be discussed. WTH. To me that‚Äôs a no-no.

Our bus driver brought us here as I believed there‚Äôs commission involved, reason being after choosing a place of our likings, he still recommended and suggested this Wey Wey.

2million rupiah for 10pax, yes that‚Äôs ok but serving is for 3 pax. We had to control as to let others at least tasted it.

Ordered x1 sweet n sour fried seabass, x1 brocolli, x1 bean sprout, x2 omellete, x1 black pepper crab, x2 battered squid, x1 baby squid.

Taste is ok.

No more other pics as we got no mood for this kinda situation."

Better to book sits in advance during weekends. Great ambience. Band is bit loud so make sure you sit away from podium.
Overall great place to eat decent steak and chill."

Great view. Good ambience. Nice live music at 7PM.

Food taste is... I think i can find better elsewhere. Tried the lobster but the taste is not there. The Thai fish is good. The tofu is okay. Beers are cheap so that's a plus point.

Clean place. Nice complex."
719,ChIJYdY6LiOK2TERSiKamA8RESU,Harbour Bay Seafood Restaurant,Boon Kwang Tay,4,"Fried fish was nice, meat was soft. Fish maw soup was full of ingredients, but tasted plain, lack of seasoning. Scallops felt tough, probably steamed longer than necessary. Stir fried Beef, fried chicken and baby sotong were nicely done.  There were ample Parking spaces, but due to how vehicles are parked, congestion can be easily caused by inconsiderate drivers waiting for parking spaces near to restaurant's entrance."
720,ChIJYdY6LiOK2TERSiKamA8RESU,Harbour Bay Seafood Restaurant,Melvin Lin,5,"Food was good, service was good, prices were acceptable for the quality.

They also have a live band playing music appropriate for families with members of all ages. The performers were also very friendly with my children, which was a bonus for us.

It is not often that my mum asks to return to a restaurant the following night while we are travelling, and on this occasion, she did just that."

722,ChIJYdY6LiOK2TERSiKamA8RESU,Harbour Bay Seafood Restaurant,Yong Shearn Chia,4,"Had my dinner here at harbour bay seafood restaurant during first night of my stay in Batam. The seafood is ok pretty fresh as well. Just that the prawn and crab are pretty small compare to the usual I had in Singapore. No complains for the price that we paid for.

But do note to check your bills before you make payment as I was initially charged for 6kg worth of crab instead of 600g (I would believe is a human error). Good thing that the manager around apologise and adjusted the bill.

There are live band singing during the dinner and surprisingly the lady is singing Chinese songs!"

All the seafood is fresh. But the taste is not there.

Just wanna compliment how they cook the rice. Not too sticky nor overcooked. Just nice.

732,ChIJWeWRkIGJ2TER52Uxj7TLFbs,Sederhana Padangnese Restaurant,Dan Summer,4,Nasi Padang here didn't meet my expectation.

Available sea food were: variety of small and big fishes, prawns, tiger prawn, clams, mussels, sea snails, lobsters, crabs, etc. You can pick fresh seafood and weigh on the spot before they cook in the kitchen.  Also got some vegetable dishes. Nice restaurant to try out the local seafood. But the food taste not too special. Price is definitely cheaper compared to those in Singapore."
735,ChIJ8a943MaJ2TERhyXbj7qF_oo,Golden Prawn 933,Josiah Boh,4,"A must visit place if you enjoy seafood! Extremely affordable and great variety.

Upon entering, the waiter will bring you to an area where there's a massive menu on the wall.

You can then choose which dish you'll like and choose the seafood you wish to have that dish with.

The best part is, you get to choose how many grams of each dish you like and the prices per kilo are already stated there so you don't have to worry about being ripped off.

Once you've finished ordering, they'll bring you to your seats and you can wait for your delicious meal.

I don't recommend getting coconut as it isn't served cold and was not sweet. Their ice lemon tea was great and refreshing though!

We were really surprise when we ordered the salted egg crab and one crab (500g), only cost $15!

One downside was, the lala was disappointing.
The shell was huge but the meat was tiny. After finishing the entire dish, we felt like we barely ate any lala. The flesh was very underwhelming.

We also tried the cereal prawn but we tried mantis prawn. Not our type of prawn so will stick to regular prawn in the future.

Will definitely come back in the future!"

739,ChIJ6-ug-0mJ2TERBkYIN7SKeAc,FishTalk Resto Batam,Eka Handa,5,"FishTalk? I give 2 thumbs up. Because it tastes great, I who incidentally only likes a few types of sea fish so I can taste fresh water fish. Previously, I didn't really like eating fish, so I liked fish, I mean, the fish is really delicious, the seasoning is delicious, hehe.. Fish Talk has changed my perception of fish. The food at Fish Talk that I like the most is the grilled fish, it's really good and super delicious. The vegetables and sambal are also delicious, the ingredients are fresh. The seasoning makes me miss, so I want to eat there again.

Besides the restaurant owner who is really good, there is something else that makes Fish Talk special in my eyes, there is a promo. Lunch as much as you can pay sincerely every Friday from 11am to 3pm. Then there is a free iftar promo for those who fast on Monday/Thursday sunnah with free warm tea.

For those who are curious about Fish Talk, you can come directly there, the opening hours are from 7 am to 9.30 pm. If you want to eat but you are lazy or lazy to move, we can also order delivery, they serve delivery, you can just call. Oh hey, at Fish Talk there is also a prayer room, so when you get together with friends or family you don't have to leave the place to eat. Just ask the manager where the prayer room is."

I ordered pineapple chicken fried rice , bok choy garlic w oyster sauce, prawn omelette , golden sand cuttle fish.

I find the fried rice abit bland, bokchoy sauce taste good but the veg is a nope. The egg looks unappetising but it actually taste decent. The golden sand cuttle fish is very unique but i personally dislike the texture and abit too spicy for me."

Located by the sea, there are many seafood restaurants on stilts called kelongs, where you can enjoy fresh seafood and a beautiful view of the sea and the Barelang Bridge.

Among the kelongs in Barelang, I would recommend trying out Barelang Seafood Restaurant. They offer a variety of seafood dishes including fish, shrimp, crab, lobster, and squid, all fresh and cooked after being weighed and selected by customers. All these restaurants are open from morning until evening, so you can enjoy seafood at any time of the day. You will definitely enjoy the delicious and fresh seafood served at this restaurant."

The goat satay is tough because it's too dry/overcooked. For the sauce, it's okay. Sumedang tofu is delicious, but maybe it's better if you add green cayenne pepper to your friends."

The Aircon dining area is very warm.
Better to dine outside if u can take the smoking area."

Everything is just superb including the otak-otak which is fish cake mixed with spices and wrapped in a leaf parcel you must try that too. The sambal and the special yellow spice that they put on the fish compliments each other.

Overall I recommend eating here but it might be pricy but its well worth it"

But it's still not in the category that makes me come back again in the near future to eat this unless I really want it. The place is quite comfortable, there is a glass that can see directly towards the ferry port."

798,ChIJn3sPGlyJ2TERkQ2IGYAjPVM,D'steam Seafood Batam Peranakan Style,Andrew Goh,3,"I think the restaurant tried to make a difference with creating a special porridge place .. somehow the porridge is rather bland. They steamed the seafood and pour the sauces to the porridge. However, they forgotten that the porridge need to have the broth to cook together so can have more flavourful porridge and not after porridge was cooked and add the sauces back. Overall food was ok but nothing special!"

I don't like this place"
808,ChIJxR_2GAOJ2TERSsgvOly_vuY,Gorengan Nanggroe Aceh BCM Batam Centre,Restu Ramadhan,4,Good fried snacks/fritters and considerably cheap too (7 pcs for 70 cents). Nicely located for tourist access. It is not the best we have in Batam as there are cheaper and tastier stalls out there. But you will still love it.

I LOVED the egg fried rice and it was cooked very well. The vegetable curry was decent, and the chicken we ordered was deeply fried, so as much as it tasted good it was also quite unhealthy as a meal, haha. Would definitely recommend coming here as you can have a good meal while also spotting Singapore‚Äôs MBS from a distance! :p"

Coconuts are huge, but not refrigerated or cold.

They don't list any prices on their menu. Prawns/sotong about IDR130,000 for 500g. Seems like a family-owned restaurant and staff are very friendly. There is a nice view of the sea and sunset if you sit further out. A good experience and more quiet than other famous seafood restaurants in Batam."
815,ChIJU-Q-VOgn2jERkzHm4YVfX18,Setia Budi Restaurant,ibk computerizer batam,5,Very nice place for relaxing time
816,ChIJU-Q-VOgn2jERkzHm4YVfX18,Setia Budi Restaurant,Ansari Maulidil Awal,5,The beach is so clean to make a very good sightseeing . They provide fresh fish to eat  and cooked with delicious curry and the place is not so far from nongsa International ferry terminal. They also have toilet.

818,ChIJhTb6KP2I2TERxiTpsdXmLeg,Baresto Cafe,EUGENE LIM,3,"It's a somehow Thai restaurant but also sell ayam penyet. The Tom yam soup is lousy, taste like tomatoes soup. Thai kangkong is so little and doesn't taste good too. Staff not all understand English and service Abit slow... Ate in late morning and vommited in the afternoon... Only ate this so likely link to the food here... Unlikely to visit again"
819,ChIJhTb6KP2I2TERxiTpsdXmLeg,Baresto Cafe,Francis Teo,4,"Family friendly cafe with large siting area and a nice view. Mixture of local and western cuisine, there's a bubble tea outlet inside the cafe also. Food are ok, and the portion are just nice...  loved the avocado drink they serve, very thick and creamy. Good place to have a quick lunch after arriving from or going to batam port which is just 5mins away."

823,ChIJ_2_DtTaF2TER_FSz3vU6xDU,Riverside Restaurant,Cuixian Li,5,"Live seafood by the waterfront! We ordered 8 dishes for 9 persons, which added up to only S$120 (including drinks). It‚Äôs a bit far from town, by worth the trip just for fresh seafood & fresh air."
824,ChIJ_2_DtTaF2TER_FSz3vU6xDU,Riverside Restaurant,Leo Cheong,3,"At the edge of the island with a nice sea view and freshly caught seafood.

Must try the black pepper crab and don't be shy on the rice - it comes in a bucket!

Smoking between tables is common and may be a concern for some."
825,ChIJ_2_DtTaF2TER_FSz3vU6xDU,Riverside Restaurant,E K Goh,4,"liked the rustic ambience and the restaurant is on stilts at the sea side.
Though fish are all live, but the way fish are bread, they taste quite plain.

Drunken prawns are good."
826,ChIJ_2_DtTaF2TER_FSz3vU6xDU,Riverside Restaurant,Jon Lau,5,Food is reasonably priced. A little far from central but worth the trip. Kor and staff are friendly and you can see him get the seafood live from his catchment below the restaurant which is on stilts above the sea. Thus the sea view is memorable. Had so much to eat (see dishes plus seafood fried rice and omelette) for about $15 per head. Yum!
827,ChIJ_2_DtTaF2TER_FSz3vU6xDU,Riverside Restaurant,Brahmadhata Prasetyo,5,"Nice resto with delicious sea food.

Their grilled and barbecued pork was so delicious and their chili was fantastic (any spicy lovers out there, you'll love their rich sauces!). Their hotplate tofu was so yummy and their tze char stuff was incredible! 10/10 would return to Batam for this restaurant. Also, impeccable service (smiles all around)! They had a few who understood Mandarin so it was easy to order. Love this place sm!!"
830,ChIJYR8kHCqJ2TERig--RTMmp1o,Meat House,Izhar,4,"Quick service, helpful staff. Great open dining area for dinner. Very family friendly. Lots of pork dishes and there is also a unlimited shabu shabu dinner service. I had the takeaway but food was still great."
831,ChIJYR8kHCqJ2TERig--RTMmp1o,Meat House,Jie Ling Seah,5,We love the fire pork ribs. Must try if you are in batam. The pork kuning dish is also very yummy!!!
832,ChIJYR8kHCqJ2TERig--RTMmp1o,Meat House,Wira Satria,2,"Location easy to find and have sufficient parking lots. Service quite fast but during peak hours need to be patience with them.
Food wise many options despite the taste that not so special. The mixed pork soup taste quite plain, the pork bbq no taste at all, and the 2-flavored ribs not so good taste. Price wise also quite expensive. Some improvements needed here."
833,ChIJEfYF7geJ2TEREKxRENcKB2w,Ta Wan Restaurant,Dannie Tjahjono,4,Very Indonesian chinese food. Still same after more than 2 decades.
834,ChIJEfYF7geJ2TEREKxRENcKB2w,Ta Wan Restaurant,cristina howard,5,"Ta Wan is one of my favorite restaurants at Grand Batam Mall. They specialize in Chinese food. Mostly it will be crowded during the weekend but still they manage to serve the food very fast. If coming with friends, you can certainly order package for 2 or 4 persons with attractive menu. As for price, I think you get what you pay. Tasty food and excellent service."
835,ChIJEfYF7geJ2TEREKxRENcKB2w,Ta Wan Restaurant,JNN Neo,5,"Nice food. The dish portion is small but the porridge is big bowl. Their signature dishes like porridge, steam dory fish, soft-shell crab are delicious. We emptied the plates each time we dine there."

840,ChIJN5NrgSaJ2TERB-qxExzpToo,Bluefire Seafood Restaurant,Derek Chapman,5,"I enjoyed visit here. It is a really good place to bring your partner and family. I enjoyed the Italian food and draft beer was perfect. Food is for all tastes. Maybe a little pricey for some people, but I think worth the money for the quality of meals and for a good looking the venue - well done and recommended"

place is clean but still it's located in an open air area so the flies is kinda annoying"
844,ChIJW8YCEAyJ2TER2Ack17WgcXo,Seafood Ikan Bakar 899,Samuel Edyson,4,"Great food, but check your order before eating. We have had ""kangkung blacan"" undercooked before. ""Udang Nestum"" too sweet for my taste.

If you can't stand wating in open space, this seafood restaurant may not be for you, too hot for my taste. Place parking is abit limited due to its location beside housing area."

849,ChIJaf0IXOiP2TERghD2I2IXS4w,Ikan Bakar Mega Seafood Batam,Martiana Sipahutar,5,"The grilled fish is really good, the seasoning is not stingy. Cayenne pepper clams are really spicy, but delicious. Tipan tahu is also delicious, a variant of processed seafood and broccoli served in a hot pan covered with eggs. There are dining areas that use tables, there are those that sit on the floor. Staff need to be more agile in cleaning tables and sinks."
850,ChIJaf0IXOiP2TERghD2I2IXS4w,Ikan Bakar Mega Seafood Batam,Bonia,5,Seafood and hotplate/tipan tofu dishes are the best in this foodcourt.. I like the crab with Padang sauce and oyster sauce the most.. The crab is fresh and alive.. the price is still okay.. the range is 100 thousand per serving (1 fish)

854,ChIJfzT9rd8n2jERofT0ceU09eI,Selera Restaurant,WR Tan,4,Worth it. Value for money. The food here is tastier than turi beach resort. It is about 7-10min walk. The view here is awesome too.
855,ChIJfzT9rd8n2jERofT0ceU09eI,Selera Restaurant,Amanda Val Ng,4,Am staying at a beach resort nearby and took a short stroll over. It was nice view of the pier with my boyfriend being all envious about those people leaving for their dive trip. Nice setting with seats available near the pier for a romantic dinner and even to throw a graduation party.

858,ChIJ90-aqapq1DER0cmt7s7qg84,Maharaja Curry House,Victor Morais,4,Authentic Indian food. The ambience is good. Food tastes good with good quality and quantity. Restaurant was spacious and neat. Staff were friendly. Food were served on time without having to wait for long.
859,ChIJ90-aqapq1DER0cmt7s7qg84,Maharaja Curry House,Marcellino Yohanes,5,An Indian colleague of mine reccomended this place and in my opinion this is one of the more authentic tasting Indian food in town.

862,ChIJ90-aqapq1DER0cmt7s7qg84,Maharaja Curry House,Miranda Trisia,4,"Tried some of the menu
1. Nasi Mandhi with Beef Curry
Nasi Mandhi is literally the highlight, the texture is just perfect and it has some smokey herbs bursting when you eat the Nasi Mandhi itself. Would definitely repeat order.
The beef curry is nice, big chunks and genorous portion, and most importantly it's easy to chew. Curry broth is on point üëå
It's also come with fresh pickles and fresh sweet tomato sauce.

2. Shazmi Kabaab
The chicken is so juicy and tender, has rich flavour but not too overstrong. Come with mint sauce, but I personally don't really like the after taste of the mint sauce. It takes up to 30mins to cook Shazmi Kabaab, so recommend to order this if you are not in a rush or when you starve so bad.

3. Cheese Naan
It is just okay for dessert. Come with additional condensed milk. The taste of Cheese Naan itself is a bit salty and has sesame seed sprinkled on top of it.

Overall the food is all good, but the service is not so pleasing. Maybe try to be more customer friendly. Thank you."

It‚Äôs tucked in One Residence, prolly the poshest condo in Batam. It overlooks the sea - so if you want sea salt in your hair kind of feel, this is for you. Prices are reasonable when you got Singapore (the most expensive city) in the world as a benchmark. Otherwise it‚Äôs pretty steep by local standards. Food was prettily presented and the salmon was perfectly grilled and sauces. But it took 20 min to be prepared which was a tad too long. Otherwise it‚Äôs the most promising spot in the city Center. #eatstylishtravelstylish"
867,ChIJ02xPdaGJ2TER-gAE1RZ-KQE,Olive & Co Batam,Rose,4,A bit hard to find it in the daytime as it was hidden. Good ambience. Food is okay. Have a variety of menu items. Price is on the higher range but it's understandable as it's near the hotel with a good view.

869,ChIJY3yyEW2J2TERClWdTr4m9z4,Myoung - Ga Batam,J Stasia,4,"The staff (just one female waitress) was extremely pleasant, hospitable and attentive. She really made our time there such an amazing one. The  marinated beef was AMAZING, and you can always ask for recommendations. There are more affordable options and the more premium ones. The stir fry rice was bomb. However, its definitely not the place if you're hoping for an authentic tasting bowl of jjajjangmyeon. Still tasty nonetheless. It was pretty quiet when we went on a saturday evening around 7.45 pm, so making reservations are something I wouldn't worry about. They also serve some chilli paste thingy instead of the usual samyang for as a condiment, which was different. Wouldn't say i was a fan though. All in all, definitely still worth the visit."
870,ChIJY3yyEW2J2TERClWdTr4m9z4,Myoung - Ga Batam,Nicholas Tay (Jehcue),3,Food took a while to come and portions seem a bit small for the meats. but still good for the price!

874,ChIJeSJRYROJ2TERpDicCky1K0U,Dae Jang Geum Rosedale,Charles Lee,3,"Comfy alfresco dining environment.  Located in a housing estate, gives off a private kitchen vibes for tge walk in customers. Theres the outdoor and indoor area, which i personally prefer the alfresco experience outdoors. Its not the exclusive or typical korean home decoration,  but it will do. Its clean and simple.

A total of 6 side dishes (banchan) for any mains or soups that you ordered. Kimchi isnt aged properly nor having a complex in depth flavor profile,  cucumber a bit heavy on the vinegar,  others are fine. Still consider the usual generous servings for korean cuisines. Kimbap quite similar to what i had previously in busan."
875,ChIJeSJRYROJ2TERpDicCky1K0U,Dae Jang Geum Rosedale,Daisy Darmawati,4,"The place is in the foodcourt in BCS mall. They gave us free side dishes. All of them are good tastes. I ordered a steam omelette and chicken steamed with ginger. These 2 cuisines are so good! However, the har gao is not fresh. Better avoid the dimsum there."
876,ChIJeSJRYROJ2TERpDicCky1K0U,Dae Jang Geum Rosedale,Meilya Lie,4,Nice  korean food at Batam. But need to improve cleanliness. Lotaced at rosedale complex at batam centre This resto is non halal. If want to find halal food they have branch near BCS.

Staffs are all kind and service was satisfied.
We had lunch and dinner here and enjoyed Chinese style and Korea style sea food.

Due to view I felt like having a meal in the somewhere far far away but it's only 5 min walk away from ferry terminal.

Definitely recommended"
879,ChIJ6xpxDeQn2jERzrOFfDlRffo,Amazon Seafood,WR Tan,4,Wonder place to have a nice meal! I love their fish in Hong Kong style. Fresh! Expect tourists price and hard to grab a cab to your resort.
880,ChIJ6xpxDeQn2jERzrOFfDlRffo,Amazon Seafood,Taehan,5,"It is a place that sells local food such as Crab and Nasi Goreng, and it is very delicious.
Also, there are various kinds of food and reasonable price.
The restaurant is on the beach, so the atmosphere is really nice."

Lot of fresh seafood and simple cooking like home but the quality of seafood is topnotch! Not to be is the shell seafood, lobster, steam fish, all the wok hei fried rice versions and fresh coconut drink. Highly recommended for those stay around here. 4 of us spent about $120 for 8 dishes."

The blackcurrant drink was also quite nice. However, due to the restaurant being open air, I was bitten by mosquitoes twice. Also got harassed by the ""begging cats""."
884,ChIJCbimXrWJ2TERiGcOAaFyuNQ,Hongti Seafood,Satria Bakka,5,"Hello hungry folks.. so I went there at Sunday for lunch, and i had a wonderful experience, I ordered 3 main dishes, sour and sweet fish, chicken salted egg, and steamed tofu. And it's simply delicious, especially the tofu, you should try it.. here's some photos.."
885,ChIJCbimXrWJ2TERiGcOAaFyuNQ,Hongti Seafood,Andrew Goh,4,Quite a real gem to find this Chinese restaurant in Batam.  Uniquely prepared Chinese food here especially the braised pig trotter taste nostalgic. The asam fish is not too bad with Intense flavour. The lang ru fried pork definitely goes well with a glass beer. The cockles cooked with special prepared spicy sauce is so so good. The herbal baked chicken is something you shouldn‚Äôt miss at all. Very flavorful and infuse herbal taste. Friendly and simple restaurant! A must to try when you visit to Batam.
886,ChIJCbimXrWJ2TERiGcOAaFyuNQ,Hongti Seafood,Cui,5,Definitely worth 5 stars! Must come when visit Batam.
887,ChIJCbimXrWJ2TERiGcOAaFyuNQ,Hongti Seafood,zgdfkl 4wcpnoa,5,"Cons:
Was not open for Tuesday dinner.
We had to go to Love Seafood nearby instead.

Pros:
Was open for Wednesday dinner.
Definitely better than Love Seafood.
Spent 60k for 2 person and we were very full at the end of it."

889,ChIJ2Xh8Sm2J2TERLQRKzvzZHSw,Mie Tarempa Sungai Panas,Maria Regina Sudiarta,4,"If you love spicy food, the Mie Tarempa will suit your palate. This savory food has a spicy taste with enough seafood or other selected meat based on your choices. I chose Mie Tarempa Lembap cause I like gravy but in a small amount.

Luti Gendang here is delectable. It is different from other Luti Gendang. The abon filling inside is tasteful, and the bread is so crunchy. I felt horrible just ate one pcs of it; I still want more.

As for the drink, I absolutely chose Obeng Tea. The sweetness of the tea can balance the spicy taste of Mie Tarempak.

The next time I come here again. I'll try the Gado Gado Tarempa menu and buy a box of Luti Gendang.

The service there was quite good. The food came quite fast.

For the location, it is easy to access. The atmosphere here is not fancy, and without an air conditioner, but still comfortable for dining in."
890,ChIJ2Xh8Sm2J2TERLQRKzvzZHSw,Mie Tarempa Sungai Panas,Julfri Efendi,4,"Often came here to grab some lunch. their fried rice is good, but the taste werent consistent enough. got once the taste were subpar than usual. as for the fried noodle, it was almost always on the good side."
891,ChIJ2Xh8Sm2J2TERLQRKzvzZHSw,Mie Tarempa Sungai Panas,Jason Su,5,"Food: The signature mie terempa and gado gadk mie was delicious. Nasi goreng's flavour was milder than usual. First time trying out dragon fruit, and it was sweet and refreshing.

Ambience: Clean and spacious two storey non-aircon restaurant. Toilet was kept spick and span too.

Service: Five stars given due to super helpful staff. After lunch here, we needed to book a grabcar to Nagoya hill to purchase tourist sim cards but ran out of mobile data while the restaurant's wifi was down as well. Fortunately the staff (name: Amoi) helped by switching on her mobile hotspot for us to use. Wanted to tip her but she said no need and thanked us instead. Lol."

And got the recommendation from a friend to try this Japanese restaurant when I was craving for sushi. Turns out it was tasty for the sushi and the don buri not too bad.

A little bit fusion but worth a visit ü´∂üèº already twice been here"
894,ChIJldFuIBuJ2TERanQ417tz_ks,Hikirin Modern Japanese Restaurant,Hazel Nut,1,"Came here for hvala ice cream but unfortunately, it seems that the ice cream wasn‚Äôt very fresh. The black sesame was quite icy. It tasted sweeter than SG. Felt disappointed ):"
895,ChIJldFuIBuJ2TERanQ417tz_ks,Hikirin Modern Japanese Restaurant,Wira Satria,4,"Finally can take family dinner here, after two times canceling my plan due to the place is too crowded. We have to split into 2 tables as we are 4 persons and they restrict to the health protocol. Lucky our tables are side by side, so we still can manage the food sharing, specially with 2 kids below 6 years old.
We ordered some random dishes, order 1 chicken charsiew ramen with japanese shoyu soup, grilled beef teppan served with teriyaki sauce, rice, and miso. For sushi we ordered aburi spicy salmon and small salmon roll. Then a salmon skin for  side dish.
All food taste tasty and impressive. The ramen was smooth with a not so thick soup. The teppan was amazing, the beef taste good, this is one of the best today. The aburi spicy salmon is something different, can‚Äôt find many place jn Batam. The small salmon roll also quite nice. The salmon skin is the second impressive dishes among the dishes that we ordered.
Drinks we ordered ice lemon tea and ice lychee tea. Both so refreshing specially for a thirsty throat. The way the serve the drinks also nice with a unique wooden tall spoon.
Overall food and drinks are good, we certainly will come again as the food quality and no MSG guarantee that they give.
Service wise is great, they welcome us and really serve us like a pro. And today we got a bonus of cheese cake from them. This cheese cake is nice and really a good selection for dessert.
Located in Mitra 2, where not so difficult to find parking place and the location easy to find. Great choice for lunch or dinner with family or friends, but be remind on the health protocol restriction."

The boss a very tall, fair and handsome guy ( Rulli Azibara hope I got your name right ) was very courteous and friendly. Only setback was the aircon in the VIP room needs some servicing. Otherwise it was a good meal and I/WE WILL RETURN and I strongly recommend ABIZARA RESTAURANT if you are next in Batam looking for good nasi padang and beef rending and ikan kampong. Cheers!"

908,ChIJQecFacKJ2TERzaBkTNPUWjE,Richeese Factory Mega Mall Batam,Deng AnQi,4,We ordered original and spicy. We changed from rice to fries. The cheese dip is really good. The fries are very crunchy. The chicken is cruise and very spicy. I am someone who can eat spicy food but level 3 is out of my level. Portion a bit small but the amount we pay is justifiable to the amount.
909,ChIJQecFacKJ2TERzaBkTNPUWjE,Richeese Factory Mega Mall Batam,jenilda melyana,3,"Apart from cozy ambience, it's overrated IMO. Chicken was salty, not fresh, not spicy for fire chicken labelled on it. It felt like leftover. Beverage is so-so. For those not big fan of cheese, it'd feel too much."
910,ChIJQecFacKJ2TERzaBkTNPUWjE,Richeese Factory Mega Mall Batam,Tom Yang (YF),5,One of the best Spicy Sweet Fried chicken I had in Batam. Comes with lots of Nachos Cheese and combo serve with a rice ball! Perfect combination

The service staff are really courteous."
922,ChIJNx626AH0aS4RlQ5CSlPnxao,La Brasserie Restaurant,Leony Maranatha (Oh Eun Sun),5,It was our third visit and we are never tired of the food. We came during Christmas week and they served peking duck and I think it was the best. They also served turkey and many other dishes. The cakes and dessert are also addicting.

I specifically requested to drop a bouquet before coming, and plan the ‚Äòsurprise‚Äô, they accommodate my requests. It went well with the help of their staffs. Their food was also good. We tried the famous bone marrow, and one hidden gem: white shrimp which is actually super good! (choose spaghetti pasta). But we are not a fan of their truffle truffle unfortunately:("
924,ChIJE1GvDtn1aS4RLfcz-MionU8,Animale Restaurant,Sarah Mulyo,5,"Expected a lot from the bone marrow pasta, after seeing all these reviews. It was good but not THAT good. The best dish was the oops cheese tart, definitely still thinking about that gorgonzola goodness! To our surprise, the cauliflower was amazing - definitely recommend for those who like cauliflower! Just the right spiciness with the side sauce, truly delicious. Service was great, the waitress was really helpful in recommending the dishes for us. Attentive and kind too. Definitely coming back and trying their other dishes and pastas next time!"
925,ChIJE1GvDtn1aS4RLfcz-MionU8,Animale Restaurant,Liz G,4,"The restaurant was surprisingly small. Honestly, the most annoying part was just trying to get a reservation but the food itself was good. Service in the restaurant was good too. Really interesting to be able to see the meats dry aging and the fresh pasta getting made. Must get the cheesecake. We got some cocktails too but their specialties tasted a little odd. Hope they improve the reservation process!"

Turned out to be one of the highlight of my trip! The food was amazing, the steak melted in your mouth. The outdoor area has great view of the city, enjoyed my lunch with the wind breeze. Will def come back for dinner next time!"
927,ChIJE1GvDtn1aS4RLfcz-MionU8,Animale Restaurant,Sarah R.,4,"You have to make a reservation first. Upon arrival I did not expect the spot to be smaller than what I‚Äôd imagine. However the ambience was okay and the waiters were nice.

We tried the Bone Marrow Pasta and it was good, however after a few bites it gets ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô so my advice is you can ask for chili flakes to balance the flavor (for a nice spicy kick). The 3x O.G was not special and it was so salty so we did not manage to finish it. Cocktails were good and strong. We also asked our server to put some candles and writings on the Truffle Truffle for our friend who was having a birthday that day and they came singing happy birthday, so I really appreciate it, thank you Animale Restaurant.

For 3 pax we spent 1.4 million Rupiah (with two cocktails) after taxes and service, which makes this one of the most fair priced restaurants in Jakarta."

929,ChIJ4UnlqwL0aS4Rsx3kmKaRK8Y,Harum Manis Restaurant,Sandra Monica,4,"The place is good. They have several private rooms for you who wants to reserve a place for certain event.
The Sate is delicious, but other food is not that good. Probably because I like spicy food, while the food here is not spicy at all.
But for those who wants to entertain guest, this is the right place."

The rest of the food is average, the pasta taste is below average, i order the agli olio but it didn‚Äôt taste like agli olio, too much gravy for agli olio standart and there is no taste except the pasta itself and it only flour taste! Beef brisket is average. You can‚Äôt pick the food by yourself due the health protocol, there‚Äôs always staff will help you out, friendly staff. Improve the cleanliness please because there are flies on our table and ‚Äújerry‚Äù in the outdoor area. Considering this is a upscale restaurant so customers expectation is relatively high."

Dessert is definitely one of the best.
But unfortunately some of food is only served on weekend with higher rate.
They should serve same menu either weekend or weekday but just put time limit or qty limit for special menu."
936,ChIJB9Y8liH0aS4R7Kogy_Nbpt4,Signatures Restaurant,Nana Setiawan,4,"Top quality food, seafood is the best...fresh. Many choices of food, beverages, desserts...from local to international F&B. By using BCA credit card, you can pay buy 1 get 1, worth every penny. Better check your credit card's offer to enjoy the benefit. They only have 2 toilets outside the restaurant. You might need to queue."
937,ChIJB9Y8liH0aS4R7Kogy_Nbpt4,Signatures Restaurant,Gary Lim,4,"Was only there for the breakfast buffet, wide selection, alot of choices for local Indonesian   dishes. Would be better if the international selection was bigger. Service levels were good even though the place was crowded"

The restaurant is huge and has a all you can eat buffet that will amaze you.

Many cooking stations will bring you different kind of food
Indonesian, sushi, Chinese, Asian , Western, French cheese, dessert ! Definitely more than you can eat. So for sure you will find what to eat.

The quality was good enough. The personal was very friendly and polite

Was a good experience for me to try a bit from different Indonesian dishes

I have no reference to know if the price paid is good for the quality or not. The price was 496100 IDR, with a Coca Cola drink.

At least very convenient option for hotel resident when raining time."

My fave picks are: smoked salmon, hash brown, chicken sausage, soup with chicken/beef broth. Even the scrambled eggs are perfection. If only I have more space in my tummy, I would spend 3 hours to slowly digest and savour the taste. I look forward to try their lunch and dinner buffet some time in the future.

The highlight is kambing guling dan various satay (beef, lamb, chicken) . It was tender & well cooked. they also serves great turkish coffe, boiled in hot sand."
957,ChIJWeqySZb1aS4RVOJlLsuILyk,Catappa Restaurant,Valen Susanto,5,So cool! I went there for a friend's birthday lunch and this was great! Definitely reserve a table if you have some time:)
958,ChIJ_02K8JbxaS4RX9G3vNqXim8,PA.SO.LA Restaurant,Alisa Levchenko-Plekhanova,3,"Very average experience.

What was great: the view, the building, the music and acoustics of the place, the champagne.

What we didn‚Äôt like: we took the most expensive stakes. Though we were the only guests in the room, it took staff 50 minutes to prepare! And when they arrived (after we reminded twice!) they were overcooked and not that hot as it should be.

It also feels that the place is not that clean: furniture and carpets are quite worn-out and dirty.

Overall that‚Äôs not what you expect paying 2.790.000IDR for 2 people."
959,ChIJ_02K8JbxaS4RX9G3vNqXim8,PA.SO.LA Restaurant,Reddy Panggabean,5,"Extremely satisfying lunch i did there. As a noodle lover I admire blackpepper fried udon. Trevally sashimi was so succulent and melting in the throat. Kambing guling and perkedel was better than any wedding reception feast. Highlight of the lunch is salmon Wellington. Definitely the star of this lunch, and silly me forgot to take the picture of it. Service was so good and they did take care my toddler kiddo very well."
960,ChIJ_02K8JbxaS4RX9G3vNqXim8,PA.SO.LA Restaurant,Marcella Cindy,5,"Visited this place for Iftar buffet. Most of the foods taste average except for the special Middle Eastern cuisine. Totally love their Middle Eastern dessert, especially the bread pudding called ashta. Too bad they don‚Äôt serve any lamb dishes as I expected.

The decorations are great, but I would say that the service is so-so. However, it was a good experience having a dinner here."
961,ChIJ_02K8JbxaS4RX9G3vNqXim8,PA.SO.LA Restaurant,Michelle A,2,"honestly for a hotel brunch buffet it‚Äôs way too average. location is so small and there weren‚Äôt any dishes that stands out. the taste of the dishes is okay (as you‚Äôd expect a nice tasting meal in a hotel brunch) but all and all for the price that i‚Äôm paying it‚Äôs pretty disappointing, both the service and the experience.

i‚Äôd recommend a few dishes tho:
1. peking duck
2. quesadilla
3. iga balado
4. sand coffee (this one is a must try as it‚Äôs very unique)

for ritz, i expected something more. there‚Äôs also a course menu where they pass over some dishes but i don‚Äôt know why they only serve the tables near the kitchen. out of all the pass over menu, i only got 1 oyster and that‚Äôs about it. they didn‚Äôt offer me or the tables near me any other menu such as the croquettes, soup, chicken and kimchi (this one i really look forward to but i was disappointed that i didn‚Äôt get any and i was too lazy to ask because there weren‚Äôt anything left in the tray). i often ate at buffet hotels (such as satoo, ritz kuningan, fairmont etc) that offers personalized service, that‚Äôs why for ritz scbd i expected the same. for that price i would really hope that they work on the service: offers coffee or drinks directly to the tables, make sure that all guests receive the pass over course, & expand the meal selection."

Ordered chicken mandhi but they served lamb/mutton, which did not taste good. They accepted their mistake and I ate it to avoid inconvenience to them. However, I had to pay the higher price of lamb which I did not order. Taking the moral responsibility of their mistake, they should not have charged me the extra price. So I felt that I should have asked them to serve chicken as per my order. Being lenient was not turned good. Therefore, it was not a pleasant experience."

If you‚Äôve been to some of the tallest building in many countries, Jakarta is different. Personally, I think the contrast between poor and wealthy people are so obvious, or I guess that‚Äôs how the society is. Having seen from this building makes me think that the government should help the people.

Anyway, for me, seeing the views from the top is not only about the lights and other building, it‚Äôs about seeing the city as a whole.
Hope it helps you to see it."

Thus, i would like to suggest that maybe they can add one variation menu of noodle with fish shredded. Right now they have noodle with chicken sheredded. I think noodle with fish is also suited with the concept of Ternate cuisine, and it suit with the sip of lime too."

We ordered the Set Menu (990++) which serves from appetizers, main courses and dessert. The whole experience is wonderful, food are beautifully crafted and this is our first encounter with Nikkei culinary, simply wonderful and tasty, we left with clean palate and full stomach. They don't have halal certification as they also serve alcohol drinks, but waitress assured me all the food is halal and prepared accordingly, that would be enough for me.

Price were reasonable for the quality of food and service - is affordable for travellers too. They accept both cash and card payment. They accept reservation and walk in."
1011,ChIJaYYdtBj0aS4R7aoVQjeIQps,Kaum Jakarta,Nanda (Nseptember),5,"I love everything about Kaum. The food was deliciously amazing. Many Indonesian traditional meals are available for choice. This will be one of our favourite places for #Indonesian food. Also, the place is quite huge, and every corner is well presented. I came here at the time there was a bar takeover event. They served cocktails and decorated the place with a Bataknese touch."
1012,ChIJaYYdtBj0aS4R7aoVQjeIQps,Kaum Jakarta,Nida,4,"Well paid tribute to the culinary variety within Indonesian culture. Their food tasted exactly as they would have if catered for Indonesian, making my non-Asian boyfriend more appreciative of their original taste. Their cocktails were fun and experimental."
1013,ChIJlbfOLJr1aS4R4WnohuhIaUU,Twelve Chinese Dining,Silly Cow,4,"One of the very few places in Jakarta that triggered me to write a review. I was impressed with the decor of this Chinese restaurant. It is definitely Instagram worthy.

Besides the fancy environment, the service was excellent and the food authentic too (manage your expectations please; this is after all still Indonesia). Out of the many Chinese restaurants I‚Äôve visited in Jakarta, this is the first worth mentioning and complimenting.

The Roast Duck was my favourite -> the skin was crisp and the meat was juicy. Besides the Roast Duck, everything else we tried was okay/acceptable (nothing worth talking about) but the overall experience was good enough a mention. If you‚Äôre craving for authentic Chinese food, visit this restaurant - you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

The biggest plus point - value for money proposition. Perfect place for entertaining guests. Food is fairly priced, service is good, environment impressive and the food is above average.

Would definitely re-visit for sure!!!"
1014,ChIJlbfOLJr1aS4R4WnohuhIaUU,Twelve Chinese Dining,Andre Alexander,5,"Foods are great, just what you would expect from this kind of restaurant, got a wide range of selection to choose both for the food and drinks to accommodate different people's taste bud. Atmosphere are super with the pagoda and the lightings, the music could do bit better though. The service I would say good, but not perfect, I don't know wheteher it's because the restaurant is too busy or what, but the waiter will take some time to come after you call them, but nothing major here. Oh, and the parking lot is a bit small compared to the amount of tables they have, so yea.."
1015,ChIJlbfOLJr1aS4R4WnohuhIaUU,Twelve Chinese Dining,Jessica Michelle Christian,3,"Stunning interior design, service was fine but the foods are overpriced. Try to order carrot cake and fried kinako bread ice cream its very good, the other food we tried nothing special and it taste under seasoned, we need to add chili oil to balance all the flavor. Egg tart looks nice but taste raw eggs inside :(
Will we back again? No.."
1016,ChIJlbfOLJr1aS4R4WnohuhIaUU,Twelve Chinese Dining,Just Jennz,4,"Nice place for taking pictures, very instragramable. Great concept for Chinese food restaurant. Food are quite good but portion a bit small. A little bit over priced but you can enjoy the extra ordinary ambiance dining with style üëçüíÉ. The dumpling ü•ü is very delicious though. Staff are friendly and nice. Parking a little bit difficult, so better request for vallet service. Weekend better do reservation first or you can't get table."
1017,ChIJlbfOLJr1aS4R4WnohuhIaUU,Twelve Chinese Dining,Rob Umbara,4,Very interesting and nice place to dine in. Price is on the high end. Foods are nice. The steam fish with sake sauce is excellent. Unfortunately when we dine the signature dish was sold out.
1018,ChIJ7QGHphX0aS4RLet6sIwTwwQ,1928 Restaurant,Abby Marcel,5,"For hotel visitor this restaurant provides menu order or buffet set of mixed indonesian, asian and western dishes. We tried american breakfast as the starter and it was good, fresh and in a fair portion. The bread and cookies are also sweet (but not too sweet) and toothsome.

The number of tables is not to much, so make sure you ask the waiter to serve you up front. The restaurant opens from 06:00 to 10:00 for breakfast."
1019,ChIJ7QGHphX0aS4RLet6sIwTwwQ,1928 Restaurant,Handoko Limaho,5,"The whole experience of this colonial themed hotel and dining is amazing. This restaurant and the whole hotel will take you to a reminiscing place in the olden Indonesia days when it was still called Dutch Hindi.

The service is great, and the food selection is divine. The wonderful fusion from tempe nachos, to nasi goreng crispy pork, bone marrow with bacon, and milky shrimp is something to look forward to.

The price is definitely on the high side...but when there's a price there's also certain quality that comes with it.

It is truly an unforgettable experience and definitely one of those places that you dont hear often but it is a hidden gem in the heart of jakarta menteng area.

To top it off you could actually go to the rooftop to enjoy a few cocktails."
1020,ChIJ7QGHphX0aS4RLet6sIwTwwQ,1928 Restaurant,Amaranila Lalita,5,"Love the aglio olio pasta, Caesar salad, steak and egg. But today, unlike my previous visit, the aglio olio pasta needs a little bit more oil. The ambience of the place is lovely."
1021,ChIJ7QGHphX0aS4RLet6sIwTwwQ,1928 Restaurant,Lana D,5,"We‚Äôve been enjoying all the deliciousness 1928 Restaurant has to offer, while staying at the hotel as guests!üè®
We also absolutely loved the Sunday brunch, it was delightful!üòç
Big shoutout to Gita for encouraging us to join the brunch today and giving us THE BEST SERVICE out there!‚ù§Ô∏è"
1022,ChIJ7QGHphX0aS4RLet6sIwTwwQ,1928 Restaurant,Joel Chow,3,"Part of the Hermitage. The decor reflects the colonial history of the place. Good range of Indonesian, international dishes. Prices are on the high end by local standards. Food standards seem to have dropped based on the last visit in May 2023. Satay Ayam came lukewarm and was not tasting good. Gado Gado was also cold. Nasi goreng with pork belly was decent."
1023,ChIJdd3B8VDxaS4Rp9xaR-L7Ops,AMUZ Gourmet Restaurant,Raymond Lim,5,"Enjoyed my solo dining experience at AMUZ Gourmet during my last business trip to JKT.

I opted for their 5 course set menu, so as to get a sense of the offering of the culinary team. There were 2 additional amuse bouche served. I had 2 glasses of wine to go with my meal.

Food:
Very good throughout. Bread basket at the start was lovely. Each course has its own focus and has various elements that work well together. The fish course was the star for me with the excellent execution and beautiful taste combination, and the foie gras course came in 2nd best for me. Also thoroughly enjoyed the pre-desert chocolate mousse, which I felt was on point.

Service:
Attentive service by 3 different staff. The lady served and describe each course well. One of the guys came and had some meaningful interaction with me before leaving me to enjoy the food, which I appreciated. Polite and efficient.

Other aspects:
- Lovely calm ambience.
- Table setting was beautiful, especially the table piece.
- I must mention that the wines are really quite expensive for the type I had, but this is not a restaurant specific issue, but to do with taxes.

Overall, a fantastic experience.

Highly recommended.
If having wine when enjoying fine dining is not your thing, skip the wines."
1024,ChIJdd3B8VDxaS4Rp9xaR-L7Ops,AMUZ Gourmet Restaurant,Handoko Limaho,5,"This is a truly wonderful dining experience. The food is amazing...authentic French culinary experience....we ordered the set menu which has the best of everything...but for starters we also ordered the escargot.

The service is wonderful, the place is cozy, and the food is delicious.

Must try:
Foie gras
Lamb
Barramundi
Escargot
Hokkaido scallop
Truffle aglio olio

Well basically everything we had was awesome

And all the desserts!!!

Will definitely come again!"
1025,ChIJdd3B8VDxaS4Rp9xaR-L7Ops,AMUZ Gourmet Restaurant,Das Tian,5,"French style restaurant in the center of Jakarta. At some time they have Guest Chef coming to serve with their specialty (ex french x asian). Fine & wine dining experience.

Food experience 4/5 (My favorite is angel hair pasta in the light truffle). The surprise menu very interesting. The bread also good one. Another menu that worth to try is escargot & foie gras. Place very cozy!  Well set dinner table.
Service team runs smoothly. Thank you!"
1026,ChIJdd3B8VDxaS4Rp9xaR-L7Ops,AMUZ Gourmet Restaurant,nicholas aristia,5,The food was simply amazing and the service was also excellent. I ordered the angel hair truffle pasta and the steak and shared it with my gf. The waiter was kind enough to offer to have the dishes split into two plates for the both of us. They are worth the price and would come back here on special occassions
1027,ChIJdd3B8VDxaS4Rp9xaR-L7Ops,AMUZ Gourmet Restaurant,Max Auberger,5,"Chich and expensive, worth the price?

Amazing staff. Hat‚Äôs off to Rakel
We were 6 and all ordered the amuz menu
The presentation was amazing, artistic and just sublime.
The flavors were perfect.
I dislike asparagus but the chef made a good job to convert me.
Foie gras was beautifully accompanied by sweets.
The tenderloin was flavorful and cooked to perfection.
The deserts are just amazing. To die for.

1028,ChIJMVBdEvHzaS4RzzD3mbhj5PI,Seasonal Tastes at The Westin Jakarta,Freddy Kua,5,"One of the good buffets in town, with a wide range of local, Western, Japanese dishes to choose from. Perhaps Chinese and Indian too? (Can‚Äôt remember all). Was surprised that it was a full house at lunch time.

Very courtesies staff with excellent service.

Didn‚Äôt explore all the areas as I should. Was there for a business lunch meeting so the objective is not really about food."
1029,ChIJMVBdEvHzaS4RzzD3mbhj5PI,Seasonal Tastes at The Westin Jakarta,Joanne Eugenia,5,"Perched on the 51 st floor, Seasonal Tastes welcomes you with a vibrant and warm atmosphere. From floor to ceiling windows overlook dramatic city views the stage for dynamic dining experience. Seasonal Tastes also has a bar, where guests can expect a large selection of local and international food to be paired with excellent wine üç∑.  At Seasonal Tastes at The Westin Jakarta, it‚Äôs about more than just dining. It‚Äôs a sensational healthy experience."
1030,ChIJMVBdEvHzaS4RzzD3mbhj5PI,Seasonal Tastes at The Westin Jakarta,Sam Root,5,"This is located on floor 51 of the Westin hotel. A very high-end high security hotel.  The price 250k rp for the breakfast buffet and about 500k rp for the lunch buffet.

The view is fantastic overlooking south Jakarta.

Everything on the buffet is of high quality. Since this is a non-pork country don't expect to find bacon here however. The buffet has a large selection of Local cuisine, fresh fruits, pastries , as well as some western options like pancakes, potatoes, french toast, eggs , chicken and beef sausages.

The area was kept clean and well supplied throughout my four + times there. The staff was friendly and very professional.

The taste of the food was good and they also have a variety of spices that would enhance things to your liking.

They also have an egg station and noodle station. If you are a vegetarian they have a lot of variety as well.

The buffet is so big and fill with a variety I can get lost.

Overall a great buffet in a very nice hotel with great service. Yes it's a bit pricey but you definitely get where you pay for here."
1031,ChIJMVBdEvHzaS4RzzD3mbhj5PI,Seasonal Tastes at The Westin Jakarta,Aldi Inak,5,"One of the best all you can eat restaurant in South Jakarta.

Located on the 51st place makes the place has great view of Jakarta, which added more of pleasent experience while dining here.

Most of the served foods are exceptionally delicious.

Starting from the Japanese section with it vast variety of cuisines. The raw salmon dan tuna are very fresh and tasted so good.

The Brisket are very tender and yes it tastes so good as well, as if that two plates is not enough.

The Indian food has perfect traditional taste which I loved so much.

Desserts are a must to end the nice experience whilst dining there.

Although it's not cheap going there, but it's worth every penny."
1032,ChIJMVBdEvHzaS4RzzD3mbhj5PI,Seasonal Tastes at The Westin Jakarta,Karin N. Nisa (karintil),4,"Great view and ambiance. A lot of variants of food but taste a bit too standard for a 5-stars hotel buffet.

Been here three times for work dinner in different year but the foods are always the same."
1033,ChIJmS8JUrT2aS4R99BZY-87klI,The Cafe,Yulius Rizal,5,"Among five stars hotel, the Cafe always consistent have great taste and many choices.
Would be very busy in the morning, but staffs keep good pace providing good services.

Noodle station always my starter"
1034,ChIJmS8JUrT2aS4R99BZY-87klI,The Cafe,Indie Saragih,5,"One Jakarta's best hotel buffet place. But oddly, my highlight from this place is their lychee tea. Super refreshing and good.

Oh, dont forget to get their desserts too. So many variants and they're all taste great."
1035,ChIJmS8JUrT2aS4R99BZY-87klI,The Cafe,Keluarga Bontanghe,5,"Definitely one of the best restaurant in this city. You can feel the ambience of luxurious dining place. The foods are awesome, tasteful, the presentation is also beautiful. There are lots of various food types here, local, asian, and western. I tried Kambing Guling (grilled lamb meat), sushi, shrimp, beef meat, ice cream. They are all very tasty.
The staffs were helpful and very professional, they serve pretty much like waiter in some fancy restaurant. Recommended luxurious restaurant!"
1036,ChIJmS8JUrT2aS4R99BZY-87klI,The Cafe,Joshua Gustaf Tangkulung,5,"I was thoroughly pleased by their international buffet selection. There was a huge variety of dishes to choose from, ranging from Asian to Western cuisines. The standout dishes for me were the steak, saffron rice, and kambing guling, as well as the delicious curry. The sashimi was also particularly noteworthy, as it was incredibly fresh and flavorful.

But the real highlight for me was the dessert selection. The cakes and ice cream were amazing, and there were so many different flavors to choose from. I especially loved the Kopyor (Macapuno Ice Cream), which I had been looking forward to trying since my last visit to Table8. Overall, I highly recommend The Cafe for anyone looking for a delicious and diverse dining experience."
1037,ChIJmS8JUrT2aS4R99BZY-87klI,The Cafe,Marcella Cindy,5,"Had a buffet dinner here during a bukber event. They offer wide range of foods to eat, from Indonesian to Indian food. The sashimi tastes fresh, and I would say that their kambing guling is the best one. They also provide wide variety of desserts, from pudding to ice cream."
1038,ChIJT_YHalrxaS4RaCoCeuFap44,BISTECCA,Yulius Rizal,5,"Had farewell our best friend, for his new assignment abroad with family.

We were offered choice something not in regular menu, but with less bone. Then we choose medium well.

It came with medium rare but easily turn medium well as plate sitting on hot stone cooking. The taste medium well was amazing, even the well done ones. No seasioning, thus it really gives real meat taste

Must try, it will no regret"
1039,ChIJT_YHalrxaS4RaCoCeuFap44,BISTECCA,Gleb Livshitz,4,"Good wine selection and cocktail list.
Service is okay
Food is good but portions are strange.
Salads are huge Vs mains that can be small to medium. Very posh and lively place. Worth a visit if you want a nice dinner but be prepared to pay premium."
1040,ChIJT_YHalrxaS4RaCoCeuFap44,BISTECCA,Azriel David,3,"Ambience was spot on, really good for dates & or meetings. But the food seems re-heated. Price was relatively high for a taste and quality I had. Averall it was okay. It could be better in terms of taste. Might come back for other menus, and probably try some wine."
1041,ChIJT_YHalrxaS4RaCoCeuFap44,BISTECCA,Puja Saputra,4,"For me the ambience is too low ligth but recommended for group dine in.
The steak meat so juicy but the taste nothing special.
Caesar salad really good it‚Äôs a must try.
The cons is I can say it‚Äôs quite pricey for the taste and the location in not so well managed building in the SCBD area and the parking lot very narrow. Force us to do the vallet parking."
1042,ChIJT_YHalrxaS4RaCoCeuFap44,BISTECCA,Bull Dogg,4,"We dined at Bistecca on a Saturday evening and were very impressed by the entire experience.
The restaurant has a great ambience. It is dark and cozy, and the tables are sufficiently far apart from each other. The ma√Ætre d‚Äô greeted us and checked our reservation and then took us to a table for four.
Our first waiter had a bit difficulty in understanding our questions (we spoke Bahasa and English) but very smoothly he swapped with a different waiter and then there were no issues. We found that quite professional and smart.
We tried about seven different cocktails before dinner. Some of the cocktails were not available due to some of the alcohol missing. That wasn‚Äôt a big challenge for us though, as there were many options. The quality of the cocktails was excellent. The bartenders at this place really know what they are doing, and the cocktails here are markedly better than the average at high-end bars like this one. Some were a bit pricey but well worth the price in our opinion.
The wine menu is good but some of the wines are very overpriced. If you travel through Asia you probably know this is quite common, and especially for European wines. The Italian wine selection at Bistecca is pretty good, but the prices (also due to taxes in Indonesia by the way) are too high for the vintages and wines offered. We opted for an Australian Cabernet, and it was okay, but nothing special. It was the second most expensive wine amongst the Australian wines. The sommelier was helpful but went too quickly for the most expensive suggestions in our opinion, and also without asking much about what we had ordered or what our preference was.
We tried various appetizers. The octopus was excellent, as was the wagyu carpaccio. The presentation of the dishes is excellent, and the quality of the dishes very good. We enjoyed the taste very much.
As main courses we ordered the dry aged porterhouse, the grade five Australian Wagyu rib-eye, and the shrimp pasta. The prices of the steaks are high, but they are good. Frequently eating dry-aged steaks In Europe and the US, we have a good comparison to top steak houses in those regions, and Bistecca doesn‚Äôt quite get to the five star level in our opinion. The flavor is great, but the texture of the meat isn‚Äôt on par with the best.
We tried a few different sides, spinach, broccolini, and fries. All were great.
All in all this was the best steak experience we have had in Jakarta, and we have tried many steakhouses here. We will come back for the ambience, the cocktails and also the food, even if we think the prices are a bit too high. And for the friendly staff of course.

And what an absolutely beautiful and delicious desserts, i love your cheesecake to the moon and back. JW Marriott's Sailendra if you see this, please add simple coffee to your buffet, it can be just a nespresso machine where the guest can make it themself, or automated nestle machine.

1048,ChIJ_8E2s2f1aS4RSraUoOQTRZU,Le Petit Chef - Jakarta,Theresia,3,"Extraordinary service and staffs, but sorry to say this was the worst fine dining experience I've ever had in terms of food taste and menus and cooking difficulties! For their price I really2 think the food and taste were really underpar
For me the worst one was the dessert, really lack of flavour and balance, if only the raspberry sauce had more acidity it would made a whole lot of difference
The 3d projected movie was great, but still for me as a fine dining restaurant the highlight had to be the food"
1049,ChIJ_8E2s2f1aS4RSraUoOQTRZU,Le Petit Chef - Jakarta,P S D,4,"This is the second attempt to try this famous dinner package, the first one canceled cause of the covid 19 situation.

We book the venue for 12 pax, 8 pax in a private room and 4 pax sitting with other guests.

They only provide 1 table for 4 pax and 1 long table for 8 pax, total maybe for 40 pax.

Sound and Video Projection is really chrisp. The music is not to loud, so we can still talk and listen to the show.

Food is really yummy but we have try some michelin star restaurant around the world, compared to this set menu with foie gras, black truffles and caviar can't compete with them.

This is 5 course meal and you also can order some bottle of wine, champange or something else.

Service was good and accomodative.

Spending a good evening with family and close friends."
1050,ChIJ_8E2s2f1aS4RSraUoOQTRZU,Le Petit Chef - Jakarta,N E,1,"Came in last weekend for lunch, we were the only guest. This should've been the first red flag.

First course (cheese & tomato) was good but not exceeding expectation.
Second course (duck) was inedible for me. the duck was oily and the foie grass isn't enjoyable. the taste lingered in my mouth for at least another 2 course.
Third course (fish) was underwhelming. the taste was fine but the texture is not enjoyable. I also didnt like the smell so I had to hold my breath while eating it. the pea and spinach pate was grainy.
Fourth course (beef) was equally underwhelming. A bit tough and the taste was very so so.
Fifth course (dessert) was supposed to be the final bang but it ended up disappointing Not any better than your usual dessert restaurant.

For the price I paid (2,500k) I expected a lot more than this, food wise. The taste doesn't reflect fine dining at all and might as well be a restaurant in a mall. Not worth it, save your money."
1051,ChIJ_8E2s2f1aS4RSraUoOQTRZU,Le Petit Chef - Jakarta,Treasures Found,1,There are no words to describe how disappointed I am with the food ‚Äî beware of fake stars on the google review. I noticed after every bad review there will be an influx of 5 stars rating with no review
1052,ChIJ_8E2s2f1aS4RSraUoOQTRZU,Le Petit Chef - Jakarta,S Delattre,1,"Service is so so considering the place, pour water almost until full glass, Throw cutlery on the table. Manager dare to argue that they were in a rush. Sorry but that s no excuse. Food was OK, but not extraordinary considering the price. Medallion of Lobster was really invisible. Desert was really not up to the standard. Best is that they charge you an extra if you dont book 4 seats ... even if the table is fully occupied.. so same workload for them. Really ????"

The decor is modern and contemporary and the food is amazing. Its quite a modern and upscale style of dining with great drinks and wonderful food. Must try the shrimp for appetizers, the scallops sadly a bit undercooked, the meat was to perfection though. The tenderloin even though a bit small but was very satisfying."

We had very good bread service of sourdough and truffle butter with salt which is absolutely amazing followed by our starter of scallops and mains of pork chop and grilled fish with miso.

Pretty good wine selections by glass or bottle to go down with your choice of steak and amazing hospitality and services, definitely a must try and come back spot in south jakarta. They even prepared us a cake for our anniversary event thank you so much for taking good care of our details üëçü•Ç

Access to this place is from the hotel main lobby also they have the outdoor bar with amazing views as well. Price wise this is a premium place as to be expected but considering all the aspects we get, this is still a great spot and worth the value."

1060,ChIJYY1adVr1aS4RakzsolZcDpI,SEIA Restaurant,Virna AR,5,"The restaurant is located at Menara Astra, Sudirman. It was a quiet evening for Ramadan iftaar. The decor was clean, modern and fancy.

We had the following which were mostly thumbs up from the family:

Nasi Goreng Kambing and Nasi goreng Asia: both are the winning dish

Dendeng balado Pariaman: delicious and flavorful crunchy beef jerky served with Sambal Balado and not too spicy.

Indonesian egg tofu: came in very thick layer with sweet soy sauce.

Bihun goreng: delicious and not too oily

Salted egg prawns: not typical Indonesian but it was light and crunchy.

Bakwan Jagung: average i‚Äôve tasted better

Satay platter: chicken and beef was nice and flavorful but the prawn seem less marinated
All the drinks are good specially the takjil Kolak we asked for more.

Overall service was pretty good. All the staff are in a good management, friendly and handy.
Totally recommended!"

Price is above the average price, it is commensurate with the quality of food. Had had some simple dishes. Love the #salmon maki, topped with fish roe - fresh and delicious. Our food oder was edamame, tuna belly roll, salmon maki - asukamaki, saba shioyaki, wakame salad, premium tuna belly soup, cold tofu, one sapporo beer, and sparkling water, one scoop of ice-cream each sea salt and matcha - totalled bill was IDR2,516,800 incl all taxes."

To me it's just not worth that price and there are much better Japanese restaurants in Jakarta for significantly less."
1065,ChIJ0QZ30_rzaS4R-2WMVNAlD04,Asuka Japanese Dining,David Chastain,5,"Fantastic Japanese meal. I came here for the welcome roll, having been gifted it upon arrival to the hotel. I ended up having many small dishes on the a la carte menu, and a few special recommendations by the chefs. The quality of food here is amazing. Fish is flown in daily from Japan, and everything is of the freshest quality. You don't have to break the bank to try it either. You can have a handroll for as little as USD 5. I highly recommend trying this place, as you will not regret it."
1066,ChIJ0QZ30_rzaS4R-2WMVNAlD04,Asuka Japanese Dining,WaiTuck CHONG,5,"The sushi is very fresh and insanely awesome. They have other options on the menu too.

The staff are friendly and provide great service.

This is a great restaurant to dine and host business meetings. A worthwhile visit if you are in Jakarta."
1067,ChIJ0QZ30_rzaS4R-2WMVNAlD04,Asuka Japanese Dining,Gleb Livshitz,5,Phenomenal sushi. Good value bento sets and quite good atmosphere. The food was delicious and I would recommend the restaurants if you looking for some good sushi

This place is nice, huge and I like the comfy sofa and music here, not too loud compared to other bars, keep it like that, Queenshead, you can do it! Last time I didn't order food, I just came and chilled. The price is okay, affordable for a nice place like this :)"
1069,ChIJofaR0oHxaS4R5H5WbvuHw2E,Queens Head Jakarta,Kenny Kurniawan,5,"Nice place to chill. The place is cozy, the staff here is really friendly. And they have live music at 9PM.

Booking for the restaurant can be made via reservation form at their website. We ordered beef burger, roasted chicken, tea smoked bass, mash potato with bone marrow, fish and chip. Beef burger is the most delicious while the rest are just so so. Service is good, waitress is very helpful."
1074,ChIJq39stBzxaS4RzSdYU01AwQU,Tom‚Äôs by Tom Aikens,J Chung,5,"Great view of the city and the food was good, although our steak had a bit too much fat in it. Also, the plate was not as hot as our server warned, resulting our steak to go colder faster. However, I'm willing go try other dishes here as well."
1075,ChIJq39stBzxaS4RzSdYU01AwQU,Tom‚Äôs by Tom Aikens,RYAN LIN,5,"Great ambience, interior design of the restaurant. Nice place to hangout with friends & family. We ordered seafood lasagna, truffled golden ravioli, and whiskey dark chocolate tart (add baileys icecream) for dessert. Small portion for the food, the lasagna doesn't look like usual lasagna, the taste just normal not actually good, but love the ravioli and chocolate tart."
1076,ChIJq39stBzxaS4RzSdYU01AwQU,Tom‚Äôs by Tom Aikens,Martin Hong,5,"On this visit tried the dinner and breakfast. On the dinner occasion, tried the fish n chips, good crispy batter, baranmudi fish, the chips is like triple fried very nice. The lamb ragu was also good, pasta cooked to perfection and tender lamb. Pork chop abit disappointing bit too hard. Chowder soup and truffle pizza were good one too, must try.

On breakfast, went for their breakfast all inclusive for 288++, good selection of fresh juice and coffee, decent english breakfast selection, too bad no pork here. Few alacarte for ordering too like the nasi goreng, salmon and ham bennedict. I will give a 5/5 for the breakfast experience and atmosphere."
1077,ChIJq39stBzxaS4RzSdYU01AwQU,Tom‚Äôs by Tom Aikens,Dio A.P,4,"We dined at this place for our anniversary and I have to say the ambience and the service was great. The restaurant was overlooking the city of Jakarta. We had our reservation around 2pm Sunday, and it was not crowded.

We had the Smoked Salmon and Foie Gras as starters and it was good. The portion was generous and it was delicious.

The roast beef was just nice with sweet sauce on top of it. I especially liked the roasted cauliflower with the cheese oozing on top of it. The roasted veggies was crunchy and flavorful.

The rack of lamb was served as medium rare I believe. Its not cooked to our preference which makes the meat a bit hard to chew. I have a hard time cutting the meat due to the white tissue ( dont know whats the name for this) not fully rendered.

For the dessert, we has the pistachio and cheese cake! I would rate this 11/10. It was simply mind blowing especially the cheesecake. Its soft, fluffy, and not too sweet.

Will come back again to try another dish by Toms!"
1078,ChIJa3jHZ4D1aS4RLRYajotgzZI,Dining Room,Irving E,5,"Great atmosphere, good service and wonderful food. Highly recommend the Italian fare.

Lovely mushroom ravioli, rich and umami emulsified butter sauce, with morels to top it off. I love how the morel absorbs the truffle butter, oozing the sauce out with every bite.

The beef papardelle was also stunning, thick, chewy, well cooked papardelle in a thick ragu with tender shreds of wagyu beef cheek.

The desserts are made by the ever-creative Chef Ali. A twist on many classics. I had the cannoli, served like an eclair. Creamy, sweet, yet not overwhelming. The candied peel and nuts add an interesting texture to the dessert.

The place itself is beautiful, a very sleek modern dining room with a hint of classic touch."
1079,ChIJa3jHZ4D1aS4RLRYajotgzZI,Dining Room,AZ,5,"Had a pleasant dinner at this place last night, good service, delicious food, and great ambience with jakarta's night view. Order the pumpkin tortelli with black truffle, it's the bomb! Very recommended! Too bad I only take photo of caesar salad."

1081,ChIJa3jHZ4D1aS4RLRYajotgzZI,Dining Room,herold siahaan,5,"The doneness of the beef is medium well. Lots of variety in this whole food. Enough for 3-4 pax. The service was nice and very helpful by choosing the right menu for a family. The ambiance of the restaurant is warm, open kitchen, and the christmas decorations was great. Truly recommended"
1082,ChIJa3jHZ4D1aS4RLRYajotgzZI,Dining Room,Suci Landon,5,"Came here for Iftar, and was mesmerized with everything it offers!
The dining room (the restaurant name) stood at 22fl of Park Hyatt Hotel, with its stunning view.
I noticed that ALL FOOD serviced were so delicious, starting from the local Indonesian food (gado-gado, tahu gejrot, nasi, bebek madura and all condiments), up to middle eastern and Italian selections! I normally did not fancy Italian food buffet style but boy the dining proven that they are different! All of my family members love their pastas, mac and cheese and pizza. I bumped into Chef Claudio, whom made sure that everything is running well in the restaurant.
Back in my corner, we were served by Miss Bella, Alejandro and Andre who were super attentive and friendly (keep up your great service!). Special thanks to The manager, Mister Agus who catered all our needs and questions with real Indonesian hospitality while working at reputable International standard hotel, that‚Äôs how you do it! ü•∞

They have  some choices you can order, I recommend the betutu chicken. The vibes in this place is really great, the architecture makes you feel like you're in Bali. There's also a really small swimming pool in this place, I think the customers can swim if they want. Overall, it's really great üëçüëçüëç"
1093,ChIJhdP87MX1aS4R38uGHrdvldU,Sudestada,Hannah Glathar,5,"Loved this place! Definitely more pricey than other places but worth it for what you get. Steak is usually in cuts 300 or 350g at the smallest so be prepared to spend a lot or share if you want it. But the mushroom truffle burger was also SO good. And the sausage too. Cocktails are nice as well. The aged Manhattan really held the smokey flavor. Finally, vibes are also amazing. Will def go back!"
1094,ChIJhdP87MX1aS4R38uGHrdvldU,Sudestada,Naomi R,5,Nice ambient place. The service was really nice. There was also a live band. The STEAK was amazing!! We ordered 1.2 kg of meat for 6 people and we were so full. Love the desserts too üëçüëç
1095,ChIJhdP87MX1aS4R38uGHrdvldU,Sudestada,Linna,5,The restaurant have a very nice ambience and I love the design. The food are superb. I love their steak with Argentinian sauce and matambre while the kids enjoy their ravioli and mushroom cheeseburger. We went early on Saturday without reservation and got the last available table near the kitchen. So I suggest you make a reservation before you go especially on the weekend.
1096,ChIJhdP87MX1aS4R38uGHrdvldU,Sudestada,Ronnie Wongkar,5,"I recently arranged a birthday Party for a friend at Sudestada and was glad that the restaurant can accommodate a private event at their private room which holds 20 people (but can easily hold up to 30). We were thoroughly satisfied and happy with their service. Within the private room, we held our own singing session which the room already have very good sound system and all we had to do is bring out own electone. The PIC and waitresses gave excellent service and were very flexible and accommodating with our requests which made all the guests very comfortable.

The food from started to main course were also excellent, thanks to the helpful and friendly chef. I would highly recommend Sudestada if you want to throw a small private event."

Ambience and service is really good as well with retro design and chill musics. Just to take note that the price are on the higher side in Jakarta area, we spend about IDR1,200,000.00 for two mains, two drinks and one dessert."

You can also watch the performances of reliable Chefs who cook directly in front of you. Restaurant atmosphere with home-style architecture, guaranteed to make you feel at home.

Menus Are All Great , Especially The Lamb & Goat Satay. So Delicious And Delicate. Shusis Are Fresh From The Fridge. Desserts Are Awesome. Not To Forget To Try Indonesian Food Such As "" Oxtail Soup"".... Hmmm..."
1102,ChIJm2jqESH0aS4RED227PWjD4M,Grand Caf√©,Ronald Ishak,1,"I recently had the displeasure of dining at Grand Cafe in Grand Hyatt Jakarta, and I must say that the experience was subpar, to say the least. The food quality has taken a drastic plunge since its glory days, and it was quite evident in the Aglio Olio Penne dish that was served to us. Not only was it dry, but it was served without any oil or flavor that is expected from such a dish.

The buffet selection was also a letdown, with very limited options available, leaving us feeling unsatisfied and hungry. To make matters worse, we had to constantly wait for food to be replenished, which was a frustrating experience, to say the least.

As a member of their ""Dine at Hyatt"" program, my expectations were high, but the Grand Cafe failed to deliver. While the wait staff and team members were excellent, the lackluster food quality and limited buffet options were unacceptable. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and would suggest exploring other dining options within the hotel."

Had the 5 course tasting menu here with a friend. Really delicious! Chef Craig is a fantastic chef who makes really unique food you can't eat anywhere else in Jakarta.

The wine selection here is also very nice. I got the wine pairing and was able to try some new wines that I really enjoyed.

Can't wait to go back and try some new dishes."
1109,ChIJzUfLDxn0aS4R1GPzRj4ifko,Piquant Restaurant Jakarta,Lily Dawis,5,"A ""secret"" fine dining restaurant in the midst of bustling Menteng. Chef Craig helmed this French restaurant while his wife focused on the famed bakery Chicory Patisserie, of which the signage was much clearly seen from outside. All the dishes here, from appetizers, mains and desserts were constructed with much love and details. Closed on Mondays but not too busy other days, reservations still highly recommended as the chef is very hands on."
1110,ChIJzUfLDxn0aS4R1GPzRj4ifko,Piquant Restaurant Jakarta,M Wayang,5,"We really enjoyed the relaxed lunch 5 course meal. it wasn't exactly fine dining per se, though the food was undoubtedly classic French, whilst demonstrating refined techniques and sophisticated flavour combinations.

It was funny how our general enquiry if they could do vegetarian meals was misunderstood and became a reservation for a full vegetarian course meal. We decided to give it a go anyway. Happy that we came, and keen to return again in the near future."
1111,ChIJzUfLDxn0aS4R1GPzRj4ifko,Piquant Restaurant Jakarta,Reza Setiawan,5,Splendid meals and experiences. Exactly as expected to be from a (French) fine dining restaurant.

Cocktails were ok to my standards and food was normal nothing disappointing or amazing about it.

Service definitely up there with very enthusiastic stuff.

There is a band playing there that is loud but if you like music I guess it's okay. There are outside seating arrangement going for minimum spending 3 million if I'm not wrong.

Oh not to mention , the view of Jakarta is definitely worth a visit."

I was intrigued by the food since it says western food combine with padangnese (west sumatra) flavor. It was tasty, yummy, and as expected. Soo happy to eat here.

Im not sure if this restaurant is new or not because it seems that not many people knew it since it was not packed at all at the time it supposes to be fully packed.

The service was great, informative, the hospitality great, the toilet is clean, n this is important, and they also provide mushola for praying 1 level below, near the kitchen area.

Overall my gathering with friend was so joyful and I enjoy everything here.

For 2 people main course + beverages, we need to prepare IDR 300.000"
1119,ChIJ_Tyhaz70aS4RFYggmK4kSAw,Cikang Coffee & Resto,HDR HDR,1,"These reviewers seems set up.

Absolutely under taste, with extremely overpriced for Padang cuisine!

Padang is a respected traditional food we can find literally ANYWHERE with reasonable price, but they're taking benefit from you by selling ""ambience"" and ""historical"" subject.

I'm looking for FOOD not MUSEUM!"

The restaurant's seem we can order a lot of food, the fact is i only buy 2 sate with lontong and cakwe (the cakwe is not really that good taste). And the drinks are veryyy not affordable. I disapointed for the menu. I can buy sate padang street food and i can get veryy much sausage than in this cikang coffee resto.
Too expensive just for lunch for two! And customer have to pay the taxes (PBB and services).
Not recommended place."
1122,ChIJ_Tyhaz70aS4RFYggmK4kSAw,Cikang Coffee & Resto,Vi I,4,"What i love:
- Good ambient. The Location is not so far from Bunda Hospital.
- The taste is good. I tried chef recommendation menu: soto n katupek

What need to be improved:
- waiting time is long. It is different with the usual Padang food where everything is served quickly. So this place is not suitable for people who are in hurry.
- Premium price. Although the price might be standard for premium quality, it would be nice if this a little cheaper."

1126,ChIJ7eBosjv0aS4RfpIv1feiios,Tugu Kunstkring Paleis,Kenny Kurniawan,4,"The place was really nice. Looks fancy, and there are many statues and painting in it. The staff here was also friendly and helpful. And for me personally, all the food was good. But just good. Comparing to the price and the portion, i think it's not really worthed to eat here, unless you want to eat fancy Indonesian food. The sambal also did not as spicy as i expected, because maybe their main target is for foreigner, not indonesian, so they adjust the spiciness of the sambal.

Overall, back to each of you, if you want a fancy indonesian food with good ambiance, of course this is the place, but if you want a delicious indonesian food, i think there are much places that served tastier indonesian food than this place."

We ordered a porterhouse (for two) which was superb! The meat went through dry age process & is a USDA beef. Aside from the beef we got 2 sides, mashed potato & creamy spinach. Well the price might look steep but certainly worth every penny. If you‚Äôre looking to have the best steak (with USDA grade beef) then this is the place for you. Service also didn‚Äôt disappoint, they‚Äôre all good."
1129,ChIJ7ZN-7m7xaS4RUg7AIKujobk,Wolfgang's Steakhouse Jakarta,Henry Gunawan,5,Amazingly delicious steak. Arguably the best steakhouse in Jakarta. The dry aged porterhouse was amazing and totally worth the money. The dessert especially the key lime pie was superb. Corkage for wine was also reasonable so you can bring your own wine.
1130,ChIJ7ZN-7m7xaS4RUg7AIKujobk,Wolfgang's Steakhouse Jakarta,Munchie Diary,5,The best steak in town! Must try porterhouse for two. Potatoes were good but would be better with more onions.

Every food were of excellent quality and tasted superb.

The place is quite small..consists of several large tables indoor, and some couches with excellent decor outside. The outside view is excellent at night, feels like in  the jungle of concrete üòä

They provide mouthwash and dental floss in the restroom, very impressive!"
1134,ChIJeYhllMT1aS4REHk4N38VwC8,GIOI Menteng,Nanda (Nseptember),4,"I've been here for a long time but forgot to review, I love the food at Gioi. Above my expectations, and the service is also really good. I've booked the private room so I have my own karaoke room.

Favorite food here: Gioi's signature crispy duck."
1135,ChIJeYhllMT1aS4REHk4N38VwC8,GIOI Menteng,Sherly Dewi,5,"The taste and aroma is very tempting.  For the price, I think it is in accordance with the size & quality of the portion.  My favorite menu is Gioi Rice, Salmon Lodeh, Dark Chocolate Souffle.  For a portion of salmon lodeh 175K including tax, it can be for 2-3 people.  For Sandong Fried Chicken, I don't think it's ok, because the chicken smells a little fishy, ‚Äã‚Äãbut for the seasoning it's just right.  For a very clean place, very good & friendly service."
1136,ChIJeYhllMT1aS4REHk4N38VwC8,GIOI Menteng,Annisha Nurilla,5,"Good choice of foods when you are craving Indonesian foods. Surprisingly, I was impressed by the Gioi's rice, which it's a seasoned rice with kecombrang and fried shallots.
The salmon lodeh is amazing, that's what we came for. We also tried the roast duck curry, it was good. I wish there was a salmon menu with that curry The salted egg tofu was good for appetizer, at first we want to order the Vietnamese roll salad but it was sold out so maybe we'll try that next time.
I like the salt and pepper eggplant, simple yet taste good.

Clean and comfortable ambience. Friendly service. We went here after the rush hours so it's perfect!"
1137,ChIJeYhllMT1aS4REHk4N38VwC8,GIOI Menteng,Aris Limiarto,4,"I went here for lunch. I ordered

2. Mango fish (4/5)
3. Firecracker soft shell crab (4/5)
4. Wagyu brisket (4/5)
5. Fried duck (4/5)
6. Crying tiger (4/5)

Staffs were friendly. Services were good. Good for family, friends, and kids. They have baby chair too. In this branch they dont serve pork dishes

CONCLUSION = RECOMMENDED!!!"
1138,ChIJTxAy8WfxaS4Rt0KGZl6HS1Y,Namaaz Dining,Ivan Aditya,4,"If you never had a molecular gastronomy, Namaaz is highly recommended to visit! It‚Äôs worth the money, if you look at how inspiring the concept is.

One small note, just to keep your expectation right.

This is not a fine dining spot, so don‚Äôt expect fancy decorations when you come in. My first impression when i came in to the place, it‚Äôs rather daunting, because you need to come in altogether with other group of diners, like coming in to a movie theater.

Also, don‚Äôt expect a Michelin star taste of food, you enjoy it with sight, hearing and sensing, not so much on the taste bud.

Comparing season 9, with other theme like horror movie, well.. the theme doesn‚Äôt really connect well with the food. But the finale is just awesome, you don‚Äôt want to miss that! The joy of eating molecular gastronomy stays with you, and your significant others for sure.

Highly recommended if you never had a gastronomy dining experience before. If you did, maybe you can come here next year when the theme hits their 10th anniversary! Proud that Jakarta have our own gastronomy scenery"
1139,ChIJTxAy8WfxaS4Rt0KGZl6HS1Y,Namaaz Dining,Yuwanda Kasikin,3,"Season 9. So this restaurant has seasons which they changed their menu and themes. There's some questionable food (in terms of taste) though and I think the theme was not really hitting me. There's also some really good and innovative ones.

I was expecting a little bit more from the review and the hype."
1140,ChIJTxAy8WfxaS4Rt0KGZl6HS1Y,Namaaz Dining,Graciela Christina,5,"It was a very out of the box experience for my partner and myself. The food were all presented really well and they all tasted really well. The chefs did a very well job and I would definitely recommend people to come and try to dine here. The price as of right now is Rp. 1,250,000. There is no menu so you won‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre going to get. Overall, 10/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è

P.S: These are only some picts for a sneak peak. üòâ"
1141,ChIJTxAy8WfxaS4Rt0KGZl6HS1Y,Namaaz Dining,Bartoq R,5,"If you are from Australia, you know degustation is so expensive. If you visit Jakarta and would like to know what level of sophistication Jakarta can offer then you need to visit Namazz. Book ahead because they have a limited number of table. We have not tried degustation in Australia so we have nothing to compare but we enjoy the food although the story line presented along with the food is a-bit disjointed. But we‚Äôre not there for the story, we‚Äôre there for the experience and the food. Total there were 18 dishes ranging from savoury to sweet. At the end of the session we were super full."

The finale they serve ice cream w queen music. Overall 3 hours of pleasant"
1143,ChIJP8bvQ13xaS4RgueoWi9kdBA,Turkuaz,Sapiderman Lumpat,4,"Good food, great atmosphere. The food flavorful and didn't skimp on spices. A single visit won't do this place justice, need to come back.

Food: 4/5 only had one visit. Need to try more things. But what we had was quite good and delicious.
Parking: 3/5 limited dedicated parking in front, side street parking and a valet.
Atmosphere: 4/5 for the atmosphere and Turkish decor.
Staff: 4/5 really friendly and attentive. Wished they'd help out pick the menu a little more.
Price : 2/5 Pricey but delicious, expect 700+k for a meal for two.
Recommendation: if you're confused what to pick, the Sultans Platter has a bit of everything."
1144,ChIJP8bvQ13xaS4RgueoWi9kdBA,Turkuaz,FWPN,4,"The best Turkish foods in Jakarta I think.

Even though it is very pricy. But they serve high qualoty foods with great Turkish interior design. So it feels expensive to just sit and dine here.

Service was also awesome!"
1145,ChIJP8bvQ13xaS4RgueoWi9kdBA,Turkuaz,Hadi Santoso,5,"Me and my wife had been craving for authentic turkish dish for quite long. Thank god, we just ended our long-awaited crave last night.

Since we always like breads as an appetizer, we ordered Ozel Kunzulu ekmek and Tereyagli cam fistikli as the starter. We had Hummus as the dip sauce.

And for the main course, we ordered Sultan grill platter, which contained 2 of wide thin breads, lamb patty, beef, and chicken. Sultan grill platter here, was originally contained prawns as well. But we decided to replace it with chicken. So we practically had 4 big chunks of chicken meat.

All of the food we ordered was excellent. All are well-cooked, clean, and so authentic.
The Hummus tasted so great. The chickpeas smelled and tasted so good. Beef, and chicken were great. I was surprised that the Lamb was smelled really good and heart-warming. There was no bad-strong-smell-of-mutton i found.
All of these kind of meats were so tender and juicy.

I suggest to ask the waiter first about the portion of the food that you‚Äôd like to order. Because some of the dishes here, comes in a  big portion.
The price? Well, as a fine dining restaurant located in one of the elite areas in Jakarta, i think their price is still reasonable.

Other than food, and interiors, the service here was also top notch. The lady that served us, was extremely friendly and helpful.
We were very pleased to be assisted by her, regardless that most of workers here were indeed friendly, well-mannered, and helpful.

I will definitely recommend this restaurant if you‚Äôre really into Turk‚Äôs cuisines."
1146,ChIJP8bvQ13xaS4RgueoWi9kdBA,Turkuaz,Allinhere Y,5,"One of the best turkish cuisine in town! The interior is so lovely and elegant, instagrammable spots everywhere. The place also has a beautiful turkish carpet store.

Mezze Platter: 5/5üëç
Appetizer of bread, DELICIOUS HUMMUS, salad, and others I didnt know the name. Something made from eggplant was so good and unique texture.

Sultan Kebab Platter: 4/5
If you want to taste all the dishes in a plate. Kebab of grilled Lambüëç, chicken, minced wagyu, prawn. With delicious aromatic rice.

Pomegranate Tea: 5/5üëç
sweet and a little sour in a very cute pot

Airan: ?/5
Strong Yoghurt Drink thats very sour and salty. Interesting taste. You should try!

Pistachio Baklava: 4/5
Similar to puff pastry with pistachio crumbs

Price was reasonably expensive. Portion was so huge, great for sharing."
1147,ChIJP8bvQ13xaS4RgueoWi9kdBA,Turkuaz,Arief Ramon,4,Very nice Turkish restaurant. Never been to turkey so I can say whether it is authentic or not but the food here is nice. It is a bit pricey though. For me it is worth it to try.
1148,ChIJNejSzeTzaS4R4H-4VM-q3gc,Loewy,Manish Shrivastava,5,"If you're looking for a great cafe in South Jakarta  that serves some delicious food and drinks, then you must try out this place.

The Caesar salad was fresh, flavorful and had all the right ingredients like lettuce, croutons, parmesan cheese, and a tangy Caesar dressing. The baby chicken, on the other hand, was perfectly cooked and had a crispy exterior with tender meat inside. It was served with roasted potatoes that were cooked to perfection.

But what made the experience even better was the chilled beer that was a perfect complement to the meal. The beer was served nice and cold, which made it all the more refreshing.

The cafe had a nice ambiance and was very cozy, which made it a great place to enjoy a relaxed meal. The staff was very friendly and attentive, and they were always ready to help with any questions we had.

I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for some great food and drinks. Make sure to try the Caesar salad and baby chicken, and pair it with a chilled beer for the perfect dining experience."
1149,ChIJNejSzeTzaS4R4H-4VM-q3gc,Loewy,Puspa Cahyono,4,"This place has been open for many years. The last time I went to Loewy's was in 2008, and it hasn't changed much.
The vibes is the same. Perhaps because it was lunch time, it was crowded but my friend and I could still dine without a reservation. We could only get the outdoor (smoking) area.
The wait staff were friendly and helpful and we didn't have to wait long for the food to come. I had the meatballs and mashed potatoes, my friend had pasta. The portions are generous, and the taste is okay. Impressed with their consistency over the years."
1150,ChIJNejSzeTzaS4R4H-4VM-q3gc,Loewy,Erniyati Fun,2,"We used to love Loewy. We came back after few years. So much has changed. We were so disappointed.

Foods quality has gone downhill since we last visited around a year ago or so. The steak used to be perfectly cook and tender, portion was somewhat bigger too. When we visited last week, the french fries was not fresh, may be they used frozen potato, I'm not sure. Just doesn't taste right. Many sauces are also not on point.

The service was great at the beginning, but we came on a group of 6, the waitstaff seemed not to happy to serve us. We address our concerns regarding food quality in very polite way, with happy face not angry face, we are easy going people but they seemed not happy to take the complaint in positive way.

The ladies restroom was dirty with overloaded pepper towels on the floor, very upsetting to see that then you head to your table to enjoy meal ?

With their high price tag, we expect the high quality like other restaurants near by. But it wasn't the case."
1151,ChIJNejSzeTzaS4R4H-4VM-q3gc,Loewy,Juliana Kwok,5,My fav dinner place so far since 2008. Back here again after the pandemic and surprisingly the food are better than before.

1152,ChIJNejSzeTzaS4R4H-4VM-q3gc,Loewy,Roland Trimmel,5,"Excellent. It‚Äôs a very popular place and hard to get a table ‚Äî for food reason. The food is excellent, I‚Äôve had the Tom Yum soup (spicy, but very tasty!) and the Australian steak with some classic Pinot Noir. The sea food coming with the soup was excellent, super tasty and fresh. And the steak was out outstanding quality ‚Äî fresh meat, grilled just perfectly medium-rare with some great sides. Service was superb, and the wine was just a beautiful vintage with lovely tastes on the gum. Hard to beat, need to come back again soon."

The burger was good and we can also request for medium or well done cooked meat. They also provide gelatto and snacks. The parking lot is quite small for cars but enough for bikes."
1154,ChIJVVVVVWnxaS4RJeFjUGiEHp0,Three Buns Jakarta,Pete Silva,3,"I've known this place for some quite long time now.
Since my last visit there was a few changes that I've noticed.

First, the parting is not possible anymore (due to the city management, they closed the access to the front of all stores on that street). You have a Vallet service - Rp25,000/car.

Secondly, the patty of the burger was not as delicious as before.  Maybe I was unlucky.

Inside the place is still the same.
The music was pleasant.
The burger in general was delicious.

I feel the pain of the owners with this street change and I would suggest them to move to a more crowded, more accessible and with parking places close to.

I believe you still have the option of ordering online.

Best of luck to you guys at Three Buns."
1155,ChIJVVVVVWnxaS4RJeFjUGiEHp0,Three Buns Jakarta,Stefano,5,"Is a nice youth club located in the center of jakarta, the place is very big divide in two floor.

There is music but fortunately is not too noisy, so you can talk with your friends without screaming out.

Definitely recommend."

The service of the waitress was so so. One of the waiter who served us didn't bring his note to take a note of our order, so it made him forgot little bit.
The taste of the food was average. I tried to order Triple lasagna and Nachos. I guess the taste was the same like in any other restaurant.
The restaurant didn't receive a split invoice (cash and debit). So when you want to make payment, you have to choose either cash or debit, credit card was also accepted here.

1168,ChIJuQszoyH0aS4RpCt8AqUo27g,OKU,Anonymous Person,3,"Review for April 2022 visit

I‚Äôve visited OKU twice, once during my friend‚Äôs bday lunch in April 2022 and just 2 days ago for a dinner with a friend. I‚Äôve got to say I was quite disappointed with both visits but especially with the recent one. It‚Äôs a restaurant that pleases the eyes with its‚Äô ambiance and food presentation, has great service, but unfortunately the food heavily underperforms for a restaurant at this price point.

Ambiance : 10/10
Very zen and calm, minimalist but luxurious, modern but staying true to Japanese design language, quiet, overall nice for a romantic lunch/dinner or a fancy family meal.

Service : 8.75/10
Standard friendly service, product knowledge is quite good, reservations were taken care of very well with consideration for special events, food waiting time was good, waiters were able to recommend dishes based on our preferences.

Food :

1. Sushi rolls : 7/10

Price :
OKU Aburi Salmon Roll :
240k++ (was 220k++ in Apr 2022)
Dragon Roll :
220k++ (was 185k++ in Apr 2022)

They were just okay. The OKU Aburi Salmon Roll during my 1st and 2nd visitwas just like any other ‚Äúsalmon hana rolls‚Äù at other mid-to-high end sushi joints, salmon was fresh, torch was okay nothing special just made the salmon slightly bitter and smoky, and caviar was just like normal tobiko, mayo was a bit overpowering. The Dragon Roll was even more underwhelming and was even comparable to mid-end sushi joints.

2. Truffle Gyu Don : 7.5/10
Price : 380k++ (was 325k++ in Apr 2022)

It was definitely nicely executed, but it was underwhelming for the price and similar to other truffle gyu dons out there tbh. Truffle sauce aroma was quite apparent, US beef was just okay it was firm yet soft and slightly juicy, the runny onsen egg enhanced the all of the flavours with its mild taste and runny texture.

3. 5 Kinds Sashimi : 8.25/10
Price : 420k++ (was 330k++ in Apr 2022)

All the fish were fresh, none of them were fishy, but the cuts were very thin for this price and I‚Äôve had better for way less elsewhere. Although the whitefish was rather impressive due to its absence if fishiness at all which is rare to find in JKT. Salmon and salmon belly was fresh but just okay. None of the flavours really impressed me tbh except the whitefish.

4. Sea Urchin Sashimi : 9.25/10
Price : 600k++ (was 480k++ in Apr 2022)

It was very fresh (no fishiness at all), creamy, savoury, umami, and it had generous portion. Although this was boxed sea urchin and they didn‚Äôt have the live option with the shell still intact, would‚Äôve preferred that one since the boxed one lacks the refreshing ocean smell and taste. The shell they used in the picture is just a prop according to the waitress. Some of the most memorable dish out of all of them.

5. OKU Karage : 10/10
Price : 145k++ (was 125k++ in Apr 2022)

Incredible flavours, texture, and presentation. Best dish of them all. It was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and when you bite there‚Äôs an explosion of the sauces inside bursting with so many flavours from their shichimi balsamic teriyaki sauce )(sour, salty, slightly sweet, all combined), PERFECTION. Best chicken karage I‚Äôve had in my life, they should really open a chicken karage shop I definitely would come by often.

6. Maguro Sushi (Yellowfin Tuna) : 7.8/10
Price : 120k++ (was 90k++ in Apr 2022)

Fresh, soft, no fishiness at all, though cut was very thin for the price. I like how they already put the wasabi below the fish, makes the sushi more authentic. Shoyu cubes were interesting, salty, jelly textured, but didn‚Äôt work really well with the sushi imho.

7. Warabi Mochi : 9/10
Price : 115k++ (was 85k++ in Apr 2022)
Soft mochi with red bean and green tea filling, wonderful juxtapostion of nuttiness and leafiness, earthy goodness, and balanced notes of green tea and red bean. Ice cream adds a nice sweetness and freshness from its cold temperature. Anmitsu sauce added an extra depth of flavour to it (sweet).

8. Iced Sencha : 3/10
Price : 60k++
Very watery, couldn‚Äôt really taste or smell the tea, it‚Äôs closer to mineral water than it is to tea."
1169,ChIJuQszoyH0aS4RpCt8AqUo27g,OKU,Belinda xie,5,"Restaurant with great services ever!

1170,ChIJuQszoyH0aS4RpCt8AqUo27g,OKU,Wilsen Tjhung,4,"A pretty solid Japanese restaurant in Jakarta. We did in-room dining and the presentation was still impeccable. They use high quality ingredients and didn't disappoint.

If there is one thing that you should order, it'll definitely be the Truffle Gyu Don. The beef was tender and cooked to perfection. The truffle didn't overpower the entire dish, and the onsen egg mixed with the sauce was very creamy. The sauce itself was not overly sweet or rich. It also comes with tempura, sashimi, sushi and other side dishes. Most of them were pretty spot on, especially the prawn and scallop tempura. However, the tamago was a bit of a let down, as it was doused in too much sweet mayo. And some of the side dishes were also filled with cheese which ruined the entire bento set.

Another supposedly popular dish is the Aburi Salmon. We felt like it was a hit and miss. While the salmon was grill-torched to perfection, the mayo killed the entire dish. It was way too sweet and a little bit too spicy for Japanese sushi (maybe the sauce was adjusted for Indonesian palate). The sushi rice wasn't the greatest we've tried too.

Overall, it was still a pleasant experience and will definitely try more dishes in the future. The price point is a little bit high for Indonesia, but I guess the service and quality of the ingredients justified it. If they could perfect some of the small points above, it would definitely be a 5-stars experience."
1171,ChIJuQszoyH0aS4RpCt8AqUo27g,OKU,Randy,5,"Had great time in here. The sashimi was mind blowing, they for maguro and some fish their fragrance it with like orange and lavender. Oku  black karaage was also good, inside of it there is a sauce and that sauce is the key. Hanami cocktail is good pair for having a sushi in here, based on vodka and sochu. Chirashi bowl is not just mere fish and rice, but there is umami and salty taste, this one is also nice"

And the espresso Vernagna is a real treat. I have come here many times and always feel satisfied. In my last visit in January 2023 I found the foods are still good but not as good as it used to be."
1181,ChIJg7H3VrT2aS4R5PgC665IvU4,il Mare,Andre Nath,2,"Mulia Hotel was once my fav place to dine in. I always get excited. Nontheles now after 4 years not dining, i was so excited to try their new set menu to celebrate my bday w/ my gf.

It was a disaster. Utterly below my expectation.

App: tuna was tough and dry. Salad was warm?? The mushroom soup was 5star tho AMAZING-despite the ugly look.

Main: took around 20-30min to serve. I dont know why altho it is very quiet night, not many guests dining. When it came, i am flabbergasted and SHOCKED with the portion as you can see. When they serve it, me and my gf looked at each other in disbelieve. Dory was chewy as well

Dessert: again, took very loongg altho it is a simple one, idk why. Taste very standard, I've taste better desserts in a less fancy place. How is that even making sense?

We got 'forced' billed 15 min before closing and lights starting to switched off EVENTHOUGH they themselves who serve very slow. We're like eating in a rush and under mental pressure from the staff. What an experience...

When we leave, NOT A SINGLE thankyou mentioned altho couple staffs seeing us leaving the premises.

Bottom line: 2 star because of the soup and considering the price is 200k nett / person.

Will not come back. Hope u can fix urself. Goodbye Mulia for now. Kinda sad once my fav hotel and I wont coming back."
1182,ChIJg7H3VrT2aS4R5PgC665IvU4,il Mare,Ahda Arifa Ismail,5,"One of, if not ‚Äòthe‚Äô best authentic Italian fine dining restaurant in the city. The atmosphere is set more to a romantic vibe, with dim-lighted ambiance. Still the best choice to celebrate special occasion with the loved ones.
My favorite dining course includes:
Starters: Foie Gras
Pasta: Risotto Lobster
Main: Beef Short Ribs
Dessert: Classic Baked Alaska
And with house selection of wine"
1183,ChIJgWKDuiH0aS4RpXOh9dwgKmU,Social House,Freddy Kua,5,"A very satisfying experience at this restaurant. A little posh but still inviting, with high quality food and superb service. Good range of wine with cheese paring too.

My favourite is their prime rib slices. Extremely tender and flavourful, albeit portion being a little small. Other dishes were just fine. Likely go back again."
1184,ChIJgWKDuiH0aS4RpXOh9dwgKmU,Social House,Ronald L. Poetranto,5,A very nice place to enjoy your afternoon. They served many kinds of food and alcohol. The nutella cake and fries was very good. I hope they can be more generous with the drinks portion since the price is higher than other places.
1185,ChIJgWKDuiH0aS4RpXOh9dwgKmU,Social House,Ivy Lie,4,Food and ambience was good but it's a bit hard to ask for service (maybe the area to big or too little worker) maybe a bell button on each table would improve the services. Ordered 3 cheesecake 1 dine in and 2 for take out but was served 3 for dine in. Service need a bit more attention.
1186,ChIJgWKDuiH0aS4RpXOh9dwgKmU,Social House,Ni Putu A. D.,4,"I came here with my sister and we order one pan pork pizza and calamary platter. Unfortunately we came during quite busy hour and get the seat that face night city view. Overall, the atmosphere, places and everything are great but I suggest to make reservation here before you decides to come. The food quite tasty and their latte drinks also very sweet, suitable for anyone who has sweet tooth. And well, this is not a bad place if you want to come with your group of friends as well, so I also recommend you to come with group of friends because their overall atmosphere definitely suitable for group dining!"
1187,ChIJgWKDuiH0aS4RpXOh9dwgKmU,Social House,Sendi Widjaja,4,"Good place for drinks and chat with friends. Decent selection of wine and beers and finger foods to go along with them. It‚Äôs a bit pricey though, but it‚Äôs expected since it‚Äôs in the priciest mall / part of Jakarta."
1188,ChIJTwTtG9P1aS4RTBuC8A4MTBA,Paulaner Br√§uhaus,Sukamdhani Kencana,5,"A staple of classic German food since forever in Jakarta. Would definitely recommend all the food here. They have great choice of beer and sausages. Would recommend the curry sausages. The sauce is good enough to be used as condiment for all the other dishes. The kecombrang ribs is especially good too. The place is located in grand Indonesia and have quite a big seating area. Although the restaurant can be quite packed, would recommend to book your spot in advance."
1189,ChIJTwTtG9P1aS4RTBuC8A4MTBA,Paulaner Br√§uhaus,Jo Anne Pilapil,4,"I was sad because I had an early dinner and was going home when the band started. Tsk.

If you want to listen to the band playing, better have your dinner a little bit later though at this time it will be full as well.

Ambiance - western. Draft beers. Band. Sports TV. Very clean.

Price - a little bit above average. A good place if your thirsty for a drink! Just splurge from time to time.

Service - good. Didn't wait too long when our food was served. Servers were attentive too.

Payment Methods - accepts cash or card."
1190,ChIJTwTtG9P1aS4RTBuC8A4MTBA,Paulaner Br√§uhaus,Marbert Lie,4,"Brotzeit platter was amazing, the seared pork chop was a bit hard but the gravy was good. Their Emperor pancake was uniquely shredded, it came along with light cream and apple sauce.  Among all the flavoured beers they have, I love apple cider the most. The place was big, suitable if you come in a big group."
1191,ChIJTwTtG9P1aS4RTBuC8A4MTBA,Paulaner Br√§uhaus,tobi d.,3,"Food was excellent
Staff was super friendly

‚Ä¶but for some reason they have a band indoors like at a drinking establishment that plays so loud that it is impossible to talk over dinner. Why not let them start at 10pm after dinner or soft & quiet during dinner. Ruined a perfectly good evening for us and probably the reason indoor is only 30% full vs outdoor."
1192,ChIJTwTtG9P1aS4RTBuC8A4MTBA,Paulaner Br√§uhaus,Nanda (Nseptember),3,"I used to love this place, but yesterday we called the waiters 5 times, but they didn't even come to our table. So I don't know how to rate this place. However, I was pretty dissatisfied with the service provided last night. I understand it was a little crowded, but come on.. I called 5 different waiters. They just said, ""Wait, we will come to your table,"" but they didn't come. My friend had to get up twice from the table and go to the counter to ask the waiter, and still, they didn't come to our table. Sad :(

Anyway...Its nice place to hangout with friends. Everything is good here. I loved the food, the ambiance, the people, and the beer! Cheers!"

Their auce dim sum was well worth it especially if you got a good buy-1 get-1 deal from Chope. Unlimited roasted duck and pork belly were my faves.

Was also happy with their dinner meals. Ordered the Sichuan crispy fried chicken and it tasted good although I thought that they should have added more of the numbing pepper to give some extra kick. Roasted duck and tofu were satisfactory also.

The staff were attentive and friendly also."

However today (Jan 26, 2023), the restaurant contacted me that they will be closed for public on Jan 29 and asked me either to change to Jan 28 or they will refer to Sailendra restaurant. Oh come on, what an unpleasant experience for me and family. Why did they give ""confirmed"" status if they can't ensure my booking is fine? I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone."

Here I pick up Chinese fried shrimp in cream sauce, very very scrumptious taste of sauce with big 8 prawns,served in a long blue plate. Not to mention their superb service.
This plate is about ideal 198 K which is about right price with such a good ambience and music.

A pot of tea is provided also.....That really make a wonderful night for me...

Wait... more of surprise, a cup of coconut pudding is offered to me on the house as extra complimentary.
Absolutely it is beyond of beyond expectations, especially the best service from Pak Angus and Pak Willie...."

1203,ChIJh8yGUCH0aS4ROWo5zuy04X4,C‚Äôs Steak and Seafood,Evan Tan,5,"They've just started doing the lunch buffet menu recently and I got to try it for the first time. The food selection is amazing. They have a variety of both western and asian dishes. Most of the food is above average and as expected from a luxury hotel.

As a buffet, the quality of food is surprisingly delightful. It's not exactly something that will blow you out of the water, but certainly an enjoyable lunch that's suitable for most people.

The meats provided (the smoked brisket especially) was amazing. The appetizers like the oysters and seafood and lobster bisque were amazing too. I loved the LIVE risotto making inside of the cheese bowl. It could've used more kick to the flavor, but an overall great dish.

I have no complaints. Most of the things I had were good. Some of the things that I thought was subpar (the shrimp cocktail and some of the desserts) was primarily due to my own personal taste and preference.

I would recommend to most that are looking for a buffet-style hotel meal. It's not cheap. But then again most luxurious meals aren't."
1204,ChIJh8yGUCH0aS4ROWo5zuy04X4,C‚Äôs Steak and Seafood,Fernando Sarael,4,The dry age striploin and duck ravioli was really good. Save room for dessert - they have the sampler which comes with four tummy treats. The service is top notch!

My husband and I, celebrated our 31 years of happiness at C‚Äôs Steak and Seafood this evening.

Everything was perfect. The place, the food and the service were excellent.

What did we have? For appetizer we ordered crab cakes. For main course my husband had Wagyu Tenderloin and I chose Aceh king prawn. Side dishes that we had: mashed potato, spinach cream and grilled asparagus."
1208,ChIJ7Zxq4gb1aS4RjlGzM1vYvRY,Benihana The Japanese Steakhouse,Freddy Samad,5,"Nice place, quite luxurious, and very entertaining as usual. The food is tasty albeit the portion is a bit small. The lobster, scallop, steak and rice were nicely cooked with lots of control, yielding perfect level of cookedness and taste.

I know you can watch it on youtube, but the theatricals by the chef is still fun as I remember it 25 years ago. Best part is I like how they select smart people as their chefs, not just anyone who's capable of doing mere repetitive task.

Expensive? Yes. Will return? Maybe, for special occasions only."

Parking space for cars are limited, but there‚Äôs side street parking available. Service was quick and efficient. Menu variety is great with reasonable price. No aircon so it can get quite hot during lunch hours. Sausage and pasta would be my recommendation."
1219,ChIJQdHVYS70aS4R1YzCjJfjqYY,Ya Udah Bistro,Octavianti Shanna,5,"Their food have very hearty portions for the price. In passing, the price list for their meals may look expensive but it's totally worth the portion and taste.

For over a decade, this place serves the most delicious grilled pork neck in town. Last night I had a dinner with my family. We ordered 1 Pork Neck steak with Potato Salad as side dish, 1 Hickory Ham with Potato Salad and Sauerkraut, and 1 Pork and Cheese Sausage with German-fried potato. They serve great food and alcoholic drinks as well. Although people say that the place is old and hot, I guess that is just the idea behind this restaurant. An iconic, home-y, warm and welcoming place to just compliment your mouth-drooling plates of food on top of their leaded glass table."
1222,ChIJQdHVYS70aS4R1YzCjJfjqYY,Ya Udah Bistro,AO W,3,"Rather basic canteen style semi outdoor, pork nuckle needs to be ordered a good 2 hours in advance, was dry,  cabbage salad no good, mashed potatos without taste, Berner R√∂sti was ok, sausages, pork chop and Schnitzel looked ok but can't tell, cold beers, staff ok, a bit warm there but overall bearable."

I love how they maintain the highest quality of beef for their Shabu/Sukiyaki and Teppanyaki. I never cooked them for too long, just a swish. The taste of the beef itself already do justice.
The Shabu/Sukiyaki beef set starts from 620.000 to i think about 1.500.000."

Ambience was really great, romantic with super city view especially at night, n the live music... also the best!!! They sing Batak songs, western oldies, latin, and even German!

Service of course also very great. Everything is really great here I could say.

Very pricey for Kagoshima Beef, but the taste will pay you off!"
1226,ChIJA4ZZ3yP0aS4RoivdWsJVi3k,Kahyangan Japanese Restaurant,Alexander Tabrani,4,"One thing that i always admire from a Teppanyaki style restaurant is because of the freshness of the ingredients they use to provide a fresh and hot dishes. And here, indeed they use old menu variations that you could find in any other teppanyaki restaurant everywhere. Here, they can maintain their food quality to their best but personally i am not impressed with their food presentation while nowadays so many new restaurants in their level competing to their best effort to impress their customer."
1227,ChIJA4ZZ3yP0aS4RoivdWsJVi3k,Kahyangan Japanese Restaurant,Felix Sutanto,4,"While a lot of places are popping out and taking over the top spots of best shabu-shabu place in Jakarta, Kahyangan remains an old school favorite.

1237,ChIJoWDK7gH0aS4R4Q18WUnbJgU,Al Nafoura,Iain Gordon,4,"I added photos of the entrance because this restaurant was a bit tricky to find. First, you go through the pedestrian entrance in the photo, if you‚Äôre going by grab select the ‚Äúmeridien hotel ballroom lobby‚Äù option. Enter the hotel and turn to the right. Turn left down a hallway, If you reach a Japanese restaurant you have gone too far. You will see a big blue ‚Äúmusic bar‚Äù when you get here, turn left. You will see the restaurant here.

The restaurant is very luxurious and all the staff are dressed in traditional costumes. The staff were very polite to me but did not pay much attention to my Indonesian wife. I felt quite uncomfortable as the ladies carefully tucked me in and laid a napkin across me while my wife did everything herself. Maybe I‚Äôm a bit old fashioned, but I believe the woman should be seated first.

The food was delicious, the hummus was rich and smooth, the baba ghanoush was just the right level of smoky and fresh, the lamb was juicy and tender. We paid 740,000 for a very substantial meal and two mock tails. Aside from our slightly weird serving experience, it was very nice."

Drinks - Prosecco in Aperol spritz was not fresh, not sparkling and the portion is very poor! Only ice. Would not recommend this place as a cool drinks bar in Jakarta.
For food - dishes we tried was fine, but not something spectacular. Was expecting more for the price, than received. Had better Italian food taste in another place, by my opinion.
Desert though was really nice and different."

To be honest, I don't like d√©cor, but I can tell they try to convey a whole concept of luxury. First time to visit the hotel after its relocation to Gatot Subroto. The view is quite puzzling in the day time. Probably better at night.

Overall score 4/5 (taste, ambience, service)
Variety for vegetarian 3/5

This #sunday #brunch thing isn't usual. I don't think it's suitable for #plantbased eatery, but people who munch loads of meat, seafood and cheese, maybe it's worth coming here. (Rp 1,080,000++)

But the ingredients here are absolutely refined. Quality and variety. I usually skip pasta corner in buffet, but u shouldn't miss it. I asked them to slice some #blacktruffle on top of #aglioolio al dente!

Bread isn't crunch, but not bad for some improvising canapes! (Pic 1)
#vegetable #ratatouille in hot corner is also great.

For #gelato
#pistacchio is really great!

Apparently they don't do buffer usually, but offer a la carte. If buffet is like this, I can tell their a la carte should be even better in taste."

Please do order their roasted pork belly, bun cha spring rolls and sushi rolls for appetizer. You must be blown away for the main, we had pan seared salmon, Japanese garlic fried rice, bang budi‚Äôs lamb tongseng and nasi goreng pork belly. All of them were my fav

For dessert my recommendations are burnt basque cheesecake, salted caramel tiramisu and molten brownies! Yum!"

1253,ChIJ91EGWSP0aS4R2FsHVktCgwk,Plataran Menteng,Rodney Carter,5,"Fantastic. We had a couple dinner and then big family dinner here over the last couple of nights. As a heads up all bookings start at 7pm and they like orders done early and eat soon if you can which is a bit of a rush. But the great service and menu makes up for all. Worth a visit to enjoy the building, architecture, service wonderful staff and tasty menu."
1254,ChIJ91EGWSP0aS4R2FsHVktCgwk,Plataran Menteng,Manish Shrivastava,5,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting this wonderful restaurant, and I must say that the great service and diverse menu offerings make it truly worth a visit. One of the standout features of this place is its stunning Indonesian-Dutch colonial architecture, which adds a unique and charming ambiance to the dining experience. The restaurant boasts different private rooms, each with its own distinct style, providing a cozy and intimate setting for guests. For those looking to enjoy a relaxing afternoon tea, the second floor offers a delightful space with a cozy living room design.

The food and drinks served here are equally impressive. The menu offers a range of delicious options, and the overall quality of the food is commendable. The service provided by the staff is exceptional, adding to the overall positive experience. I found the combination of delectable cuisine and attentive service to be a winning formula.

The restaurant is ideal for various occasions, whether it's a romantic dinner for couples, business meetings, or gathering with family. I particularly appreciated that the food, even the fried dishes, was not overly greasy. It is a suitable place to bring parents, as the flavors lean towards healthier options without relying heavily on artificial seasonings. While some dishes I ordered may have lacked a bit of flavor, the overall focus on healthier ingredients was evident.

In addition to the excellent service and delectable cuisine, I was impressed by the cleanliness and spaciousness of the restaurant, including the well-maintained restroom facilities. Overall, this restaurant offers a satisfying dining experience that combines architectural beauty, warm ambiance, friendly service, and a menu filled with flavorsome dishes. I highly recommend paying a visit to indulge in the delightful atmosphere and enjoy a taste of fine Indonesian cuisine."

The place is clean and private like how it should be, everything is good. The service is super!!!

The restaurant is located inside AYANA midplaza so there's a lot of parking space and it's not so crowded."

All the food we ordered is very delicious, taste more like  a next level of home cooked food. The seasoning is well balanced and smooth, not over powering.

Chicken satay : 1 portion is 5 pcs, nothing exra ordinary about the taste though

Grilled jumbo prawn : I expected something more with the price (290K for 2 pcs). The taste is actually good but the meat is kinda tough, maybe it was abit over cooked

Grilled lemon chicken : the hero of our lunch today, this is very very good.. the lemongrass sauce so tasty but delicate, the chicken is so juicy and tender

The service is also great. But what I wanna highlight is the ambience of the restaurant. It's quite gloomy, there are so many unique and old stuffs like statues, old photos, etc. Feels like you're eating in your grandma house with 30s-40s vibes."

Ms. Rista in particular was helpful to arrange and accomodate our demand, as we kept inceasing the number of attending pax and I ended up with booking of 122 pax that was almost tripled the initial booking. The demands were well accomodated and the event went smoothly.

Food wise the buffet dishes tasted good and varied. Great value for the price when you compare to other 4-5 star hotels, even 3 star hotels. The set up was different stalls of Indonesian dishes, so guests could choose dishes to their taste.

As the location was strategic near MRT and busway stops, it was easy for my friends to attend the iftar event."

There were  8 of us and it took so loong to get our meals on the table. My colleague several times asked for his order nasi goreng or fried rice which we believed supposed to be a simple meal to cook. And untill everybody finished their meals, my order nasi lemak still not ready. Finally I ordered it for taking away as we could wait any longer!
And it was the worst nasi lemak ever without any meat on it!!! Green rice, potato, 1 boiled egg and some anchovy peanut. Very dissapointed experience!"

In addition to the steak, there was a wide selection of Japanese dishes to choose from, and everything I tried was top-notch.

The dessert selection was also impressive, with a range of fine options to choose from. The atmosphere of the restaurant was high class and added to the overall dining experience."

They offer variation of food from American, Chinese, Indonesian, Korean, etc. Plenty of options available. In terms of taste, for a hotel food is superb (for me as Indonesian)."

1282,ChIJ3WK32eTzaS4RgnBUrKIc10Q,Asia Restaurant,Hani Calista,2,"I tried some dishes here, the English breakfast and sushi were good. The desserts not all of them were good. The fish and dimsum were too dry, they even didn‚Äôt toast the bread so it was extremely chewy for a bite. Furthermore, they didn‚Äôt marinate the seafoods well. The drinks, all of them were terrible. Sugar in fresh juice, the wedang jahe was plain. It‚Äôs a pricey buffet all you can eat in 5 stars hotel but the standard of the food was just disappointing!"

I got beef tataki it was sooo fresh,their miso soup a bit different but really delicious, don‚Äôt ask for the teppan and robatayako, their quality is at the top! But i expect their mini lobster, i had it before pandemic here. I HOPE they will bring the lobster back to the teppan menu!! Also , All of the staff was so attentive! No wonder it is five star hotel restaurant! Thanks!"
1284,ChIJMWYWVLT2aS4RFCIdHdxDb3o,Edogin,Vieren Chen,4,"Came here to celebrate mom's bday. First time here...food choices are not too variant, some of them have good quality, some not. Tables arrangement are too tight for me especially covid is still around. So it's hard to talk to others because it was quite noisy. Price is a bit too high. Located inside Mulia Hotel in Senayan."
1285,ChIJMWYWVLT2aS4RFCIdHdxDb3o,Edogin,Feliciana Xie,4,"Edogin is a Japanese restaurant inside Hotel Mulia Senayan that serves all you can eat dining. The place is spacious and comfortable to dine in with friendly service from the staffs as well. During the pandemic, they follow the COVID-19 precaution, one of them by providing the acrylics on each table for physical distancing .

They provide variant of appetizer, teppanyaki, ramen, udon, sushi, sashimi, tempura, desserts including cakes, pudding, and ice cream.

Here are my recommendation that you should try :
- Appetizer : Baby Octopus, Mixed Tataki (salmon, tuna, snapper, beef)
- Main dishes : Pork Chasiu Ramen or Udon, Teppanyaki (choose the toppings as you like!)
- Dessert : Coffee Pudding (for black coffe lovers only!)"

There was a certain charm and feel of sophistication coming down the hotels long sweeping staircase and then finding EDOGIN resplendantly ready to welcome its Japanese food lovers..."
1287,ChIJMWYWVLT2aS4RFCIdHdxDb3o,Edogin,Tere Santa,5,"Japanese restaurant buffet that you should try. The Beef Tataki and Salmon Tataki are amazing!! (Medium rare seafood or red meat, pour with hot oil with mild spices or something). They also have Sushi Station, Grill Station, Sashimi Stasion, Noodle Station,  Teppannyaki Station and Dessert Station. All the ingredients are fresh, I have no any complain with seafood. And also they have big portion of Salmon Skin! Soo tasty!!"

1289,ChIJ_1ioH2v0aS4ROmUXwjBgsUA,OPEN Restaurant,Eugene Kristiono,4,"Had a Bites & Brunch promo at Open by DoubleTree.

The place has good ambience. The space is not as big as i thought it would be. Not sure if this is because they are adjusting to the COVID19 policy or it's just they way it is.

I'd say they give a pretty fair deal. The normal price is surprisingly cheap for an AYCE Lunch at a 4 star hotel. Some of the foods taste great, some of them are misses.

Out of all of the menu i tasted, i'd say their hainan chicken rice takes the cake. Their sushi and pasta... let's say the sushi tastes plain, and the pasta is undercooked.

One suggestion to the management, ""perhaps give more lighting to the food stand to make it more appealing"". I especially have some issue with the sushi stand. It's still too dark even though they have lighting on top of it.

I would suggest you to make reservation before coming and perhaps ask them if promo is available. Their admin on whatsapp is quite informative.

In terms of staff, i'd say this place has a more of a fun friend kind of energy. Not too formal, so i'm a bit taken a back since it's my first.

All in all, i'd give 3.7 of 5."
1290,ChIJ_1ioH2v0aS4ROmUXwjBgsUA,OPEN Restaurant,Ardian Sapoetro,1,"Not worth the price.
Overcrowded during dinner & AC doesnt work well, damn hot!

They serve durian though which is interesting. But unfortunately mine was tasteless."

For 2 persons dining there, the bill was in about RP652,000 for 4 dishes (ikan gurame goreng, cumi masak kecap, baby kailan jamur & ayam goreng confit plus 4 jus jeruk). Getting a taxi back to our hotel was a major problem. We had to wait more than 45 mins to finally get a ride. Next time, we will get the driver to wait till we finish dinner."

1299,ChIJd3WDhU71aS4R7SGOztNM7NY,Bungarampai restaurant,Rereki Ratikha,5,"The food was amazing. Everything served was tasty, right amount of serving size and beautifully presented.

Bear in mind I had no idea of the dish name because I didn't order by myself, never seen the menu since I was seated. So I'll try to describe the food as best as I can.

Start with crispy chicken fingers sprinkled with sesame seed and tumis kecipir
It was my first time eating kecipir and I actually never thought it was so good.

Next I had (kind of) beef soup. Consisted of diced cut beef, sliced tomato, peanuts, etc. It was flavorful and tasty from the broth.

After the soup, I had white rice and pandan green rice formed into a cone wrapped with banana leaf. They also served with various satay, kentang balado and other things I forgot.
I would say the satay was tender and juicy and kentang balado was spicy enough as suggested by its name.

And it ends with dessert from 'tape'. A bit crispy outside and soft texture inside. Sweet yet you can taste tangy from the fermentation and I think it was alcoholic as well. It had been a long time since I had seen (kind of) 'colenak/tape'1 served as a dessert, so it was a bit of a surprise as well as reminiscing about the past.

Sorry no pictures of the food this time. I was here for a meeting with a client, and she asked me to not use my phone on the table."
1300,ChIJd3WDhU71aS4R7SGOztNM7NY,Bungarampai restaurant,Putra P,4,"Bungarampai Restaurant offers a truly memorable dining experience that showcases the best of Indonesian cuisine. The restaurant's charming setting and attentive service create a warm and inviting atmosphere. The Rendang, a slow-cooked beef dish in a rich and aromatic coconut sauce, was a definite highlight. The tender meat, infused with a harmonious blend of spices, melted in my mouth and left a lasting impression. The diverse menu also features an array of vegetarian options, ensuring that there is something for everyone. The talented chefs and friendly staff made the dining experience even more exceptional, providing personalized recommendations and ensuring that every detail was taken care of. Bungarampai Restaurant is a culinary gem that should not be missed for those seeking an unforgettable Indonesian dining experience."

Will definitely return!"

The food is just alright, overall they are too salty and flat taste. Pre-meal breads are a little rough to my liking. It‚Äôs olive oil is alright. Balsamic vinegar improvised to the local taste which is thick and with added sugar. Request for pure balsamic and they will serve it. Wonder if authentic Italian food served sweet balsamic vinegar?"
1305,ChIJKSZNwHHxaS4RHzihVeiYYN4,Patio Venue & Dining,Edward Santoso,5,"Very good taste. Bravo! Many times I've visited this place, but this was my first time after they reopened this place after pandemic. Let's not expect the waitress is nice as nice as it was used to be, like I told them that I found few a bit sharp objects on the pizza, I guess that it was part of seasonings or maybe shrimp skin, I'm not sure, but they just took it and leave without saying sorry. Well, it takes time to recover and reeducate their staff. Anw, good place!"

Suitable for big group dining. However food were just okay, nothing special. The taste were mostly bland, not daring enough. The photos in the menu even looked much more delicious than the real dishes.

Nasi Goreng cumi: 3.5/5

Prawn Pasta: 3/5
So spicy!! Too spicy for a pasta. The spiciness didnt go away even after drinking. Felt like taking ""Boncabe""

Spagetthi Alla Ragu: 3.5/5
similar to Beef Bolognaise

Ginger Lemongrass Tea: 4/5
Great for throat. Good combination of both herbal ingredients

Complimentary bread were great! I really love the bread. They were soft and tasted good."

The entire meal, staffs were accommodating, courteous, and attentive to our requirements. They had a thorough understanding of the menu, which made placing our order a breeze. The majority of the foods on the menu were exceptional in both taste and presentation.

This restaurant is a great spot for gatherings or welcoming guests from abroad, as it provides a perfect blend of Javanese ambiance and luxurious feel. The seating arrangement was spacious and comfortable, making it ideal for both intimate and larger groups. Overall, I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a memorable dining experience with excellent service, mouth-watering cuisine, and a touch of luxury."
1309,ChIJU80L2nbxaS4R_m_3MgI5JiM,Plataran Dharmawangsa,Anthony Huszar,5,A solid 4.5. Food and service both pretty good (although not exceptional)... But what made this place amazing is the ambiance and decor. Lots of wood and beautiful art. Price quite good given the setting. Paid about 600k for 2 people. Gets busy so suggest booking if you are fixed on coming here.
1310,ChIJU80L2nbxaS4R_m_3MgI5JiM,Plataran Dharmawangsa,Sani Ario,3,"This place has amazing food. Our ox tail, lumpia, nasi goreng, grilled chicken were delightful and exemplified top notch Indonesian cuisine. But all this was was let down with the haphazard serving of our food where things didn't come together and dishes were missing. Granted, Plataran was packed last night and the back of house seem to struggle to cope with the demand of big groups. Was disappointed to not have had the duck with manggis sauce, which we waited a long time for and was deemed unavailable in the end. The tape bakar was delicious. For this price range, the expectation is high, close to perfection, and Plataran was a slight disappointment in this instance."
1311,ChIJU80L2nbxaS4R_m_3MgI5JiM,Plataran Dharmawangsa,T Susatyo,4,"Nice ambience with Javanese wooden carved, food was fair, I like ""Udang Ramayana"" and ""Mie Panjang Umur"", Ikan Gurame Nusantara was too sour for me and tauge ikan asin tastes flat."
1312,ChIJU80L2nbxaS4R_m_3MgI5JiM,Plataran Dharmawangsa,Rita NK,5,"A recommended Luxurious Indonesian Restaurant in Jakarta. Right place for lunch/dinner meeting especially if your potential clients are coming from other country. Most of my clients were amazed with the restaurant interior, delicious foods, the atmosphere and they're willing to come back.
Please keep the great taste and high level service from the restaurant staff"
1313,ChIJRerxK3DxaS4RIwwByfYBlY8,Agneya Restaurant,Reyga Rivaldi,5,"An excellent place with nice ambience to try (fairly) authentic Indonesian food.

Similar concept with Seribu Rasa or Remboelan, with lesser option of menu to choose from (in my opinion). But that did not make them less delicious.

I like their Ayam Bambu and Nasi Jagung. The crews also served us super nice. They suggest and remind us not to order too much in order to enjoy our appetite. Followed by casual conversation asking about how the meals fared to our liking.

Overall a nice place to revisit."
1314,ChIJRerxK3DxaS4RIwwByfYBlY8,Agneya Restaurant,Kania Jennifer,5,"The restaurant serves Indonesian fushion food in a fancy traditional ambience. The food is decent yet unique, and their famous fried corn def deserves the hype! Kinda dissappointed with the drink we ordered (watermelon coconut signature drink). But the cocktail was great."
1315,ChIJRerxK3DxaS4RIwwByfYBlY8,Agneya Restaurant,cindy tisnohadi,5,"Is it pricey? yes, is it worth it? absolutely. Do try to go with a big group because the food are meant to be shared. The service is great, all servers are very attentive.

My favorite is the kakap merah mangga muda, the mangga salad is very fresh. The meat from the sapi genteng is juicy and tasty. My vegetarian grandma loves the kecipir melinjo.

The ayam bambu is good, not great, the shrimp is fine and the sate kambing is a bit harder to chew but still tastes great."
1316,ChIJRerxK3DxaS4RIwwByfYBlY8,Agneya Restaurant,Anajmi Nurintyo,4,"the restaurant is surrounded by greenery and glass window, the chandeliers add a touch of class. foods were tasty even though the portion was so small. the price is expensive considering the portion."
1317,ChIJRerxK3DxaS4RIwwByfYBlY8,Agneya Restaurant,Ellen Brigitta,3,"Definitely overpriced. Taste is acceptable but nothing too special for the price range.
The corn which is the most talk about is actually just corn with a lot of artificial corn powder, like you find on cheetos. And the price of ice tea is 40K idr, and not even refillable nor served nicely. Not my favorite place"
1318,ChIJnSa5FlvxaS4R9_E5t2Wxalc,Sofia At The Gunawarman,Jamie choi,5,"I always has wanna visit here whenever I passed this street.  The exterior of this restaurant is absolutely taking my eyes, which is so different from other buildings. Once get inside, I saw the high and so gorgeous interior. My friends told me that it's better to go at lunch time for brunch, but I think evening time is much better.
all food I had were nice and service was good too. especially I liked the light -mood.
will visit again."
1319,ChIJnSa5FlvxaS4R9_E5t2Wxalc,Sofia At The Gunawarman,Muhammad Agneza Arifin,5,"I've heard a lot about this fancy place. Also heard about the fancy prices too haha. So I went there to celebrate my wife's birthday and somewhat had mild expectations. High prices don't always promise high quality in this city. Oh how I was proven wrong. As soon as I entered, this amazing scent shot up my nose with jasmine notes that I could never get tired of. Seriously. I think I mentioned 10 times to my wife about how much I love the scent. Now let's get to the food. I ordered this food which I could barely pronounce and when I took that first bite, I was truly blown away. Look at the food photos I took and all of it tasted amazing. I dare to say that it is worth the price (I would even pay for the scent haha).

The staff was also very nice and of course I asked them to bring a birthday cake for my wife and they let me choose from their selection of cakes. Not only cake was brought, but also a whole ensemble to sing happy birthday.

Probably the only downside is the portion. It's a ""pretty"" portion. But I guess it made want to come back for more. Great job Sofia. This is by far the longest review I've ever written. That reflects how much I loved it there. 10/10!"
1320,ChIJnSa5FlvxaS4R9_E5t2Wxalc,Sofia At The Gunawarman,Nurmalita Titania,5,"We were there to celebrate my boyfriend birthday.

Service: 5/5
They are not judging, and really helpful to us. Serving us with so beautiful smile, kind tone, and always there to help even without us asking. They also really good at singing happy birthday.

Food : 9.75/10

Braised Lamb shank (5/5)
Price : 430k (tax included)
The lamb was really tender and juicy and smooth and flavorful. The rice was tinted with a lot of spice, but not overpowering  the smell is smooth but spot on.  Sweet, spicy, savory, and umami. Real good food.

Capellini tartuffo (4.5/5)
Price : 147k (tax included)
It should be called bunch of truffle with angel hair pasta from how much the truffle gets inside the pasta. So so good, the truffle is present but not overpowering the pasta and creamy sauce. It gets boring near the end though, because it has no protein or texture variation.

Champignon soup with truffle oil (5/5)
Price : 130k (tax included)
Everything you ask in a bowl. Creamy? You got it. Umami savory? Yes it is. Hint of sweet? Yess, with a lot of fragrant from the truffle oil that enhance the taste from cream soup to heaven feast. It's even better when it gets cold

Sofia chocolate cake (3.5/5)
Price : 140k (tax included)
Well, the only outsider here. Like yeah it's a chocolate cake, but not a chocolate cake you will remember. I even prefer the Harvest's chocolate cake over this one. Since the sweetness overpowering the chocolate and milky taste. But it's cute, it also cute if you want to adds writings on there to surprise your loved one.

Coco banana (4/5)
Price : 100k (tax included)
It's good, and sweet, and has bold fresh fruits taste to it. With fried coconut shaving, coconut meat, coconut milk and hints of banana."

1322,ChIJnSa5FlvxaS4R9_E5t2Wxalc,Sofia At The Gunawarman,Monike San,5,"Indulging in a delightful culinary experience at this exquisite fine dining restaurant was a treat for the senses. Offering a diverse range of dishes spanning from Western to Asian, with a particular focus on Indonesian cuisine, it truly catered to every palate.

The moment the dishes arrived, it was evident that both presentation and portion sizes were given utmost attention. Each plate was meticulously crafted, showcasing the chef's artistic flair. The pasta with truffle was a revelation‚Äîa harmonious blend of flavors that danced on the taste buds. The truffle infused a rich earthiness, elevating the dish to new heights. Accompanying it was the sate marangi with sambal matah, a tantalizing Indonesian delight. The skewers were succulent and bursting with authentic flavors, perfectly complemented by the zesty sambal matah.

The ambiance of the restaurant exuded elegance and sophistication. The tasteful decor, subdued lighting, and plush seating created a refined atmosphere that enhanced the overall dining experience. The waitstaff, dressed impeccably in elegant uniforms, added a touch of class to the proceedings. Their attentive and professional service elevated the evening, ensuring that every need was met with a warm smile.

In conclusion, this fine dining establishment left an indelible impression. The generous portion sizes, meticulous presentation, and a focus on Indonesian cuisine made it a standout experience.

1339,ChIJd_aNsxMXei4RWd3XksD6t2I,Lombok Bakar Tumano (Pusat),Ni'mah Qoriah,4,"Try the new restaurant near the house which is in a strategic location.

Actually the food is good but not fresh. The model is that all dishes have been fried first. Order grilled tilapia and roasted duck, it's delicious and the burnt taste is pervasive too. If the broccoli ca is overcook it seems like it's been cooked first then all you have to do is heat it up when it's served so it's not fresh and the broccoli isn't crunchy.

The place is spacious, the joglo model has indoor and outdoor rooms. Suitable for any event. The place is quite quiet. But the service is also unsatisfactory, because there are orders that don't come even though there's no one besides us. Hopefully the quality can be improved from all aspects so that it sells well"

There is a clean toilet, there is a fan, the room feels shady, if it is a little cloudy it feels dim, it would be nice to turn on the lights so that it makes you comfortable.

The rice is in the basket style, fortunately I ordered 1 portion and it contained a lot, it didn't run out for both of us.

The mendoan is delicious, the fish is delicious, the rib soup is delicious, the kale is salty, the balado jengkol is hard and doesn't taste fresh. Overall good. Only for food that is placed openly along the table near the cashier, there are lots of flies.. hopefully you can find a solution.."
1341,ChIJd_aNsxMXei4RWd3XksD6t2I,Lombok Bakar Tumano (Pusat),Dean Handiyansyah,2,"Actually, I don't want to review like this, but so what?

Over price, and long service
even though there were only the two of us

So we ordered the skin package and the tilapia package plus the chicken package in a wrap

The skin package is normal, only from the title of the restaurant, there is grilled chili, I hope there is a small container where there is chili sauce and side dishes on it, it's just chili sauce, upritt hadeh

As for the tilapia, this is a bit bad, the tilapia wasn't fresh, maybe yesterday's tilapia. from the smell and taste already visible

Then add a 10% tax, oh, it's like eating at just this top restaurant, how much turnover do you get, how come you're taxing everything? it's not as busy as the stall next door üò´

We definitely ordered too much though!

It‚Äôs a little difficult to find - you have to go to the end of the driveway and you‚Äôll see a sign that says ‚ÄúSikara‚Äù and under that on the black bit it says ‚ÄúLa Cabana‚Äù. Would love to see this more obvious. But once you‚Äôre there you are greeted at the front be a lovely smiling girl and can walk through to the restaurant. Worth finding though."
1388,ChIJtyw4ALipzS0Rpov2eUBWYJU,La Caba√±a Lombok,Gloria Gil,5,"I really wanted to eat Spanish food, this place was recommended to me...
I can only say that it is incredible.
As a Spaniard and knowing the dishes well, it was like eating in a good restaurant in Spain.
Good pretty and cheap.
I'll be back on Saturday for paella.
Highly recommended."
1389,ChIJtyw4ALipzS0Rpov2eUBWYJU,La Caba√±a Lombok,jason lai,5,Food was well worth the distance travelling to get here. Portions were big and flavourful. The paella was a good surprise by the sheer size of the plate and the rice was marvellously cooked full of flavour. Definitely recommend making a trip down for some quality Spanish food at reasonable prices!
1390,ChIJtyw4ALipzS0Rpov2eUBWYJU,La Caba√±a Lombok,Michelle Yau,5,The comments on Google are truly good. The flavours of each dish were so fantastic! The drinks are tasty too! They provide 50% discount on paella menu on each Saturday now which is so lucky to us.   It takes 40 mins to wait the paella. It provides different chessboards and playing cards to play while we were waiting for our main course which is so good! Highly recommend it. The location is in Sikara Hotel.
1391,ChIJtyw4ALipzS0Rpov2eUBWYJU,La Caba√±a Lombok,Ophelie Chuffart,5,"What an amazing setting.
The restaurant is entirely made of bamboo and surrounded by plants. The decoration is splendid and renders the place highly stylish and mesmerizing.
We got a delectable falafel wrap, and some tasty avocado toasts with poached eggs. The whole experience was a success."
1392,ChIJjUIwWCuozS0RYMQ5nRsAdjg,Kenza Cafe & Restaurant Kuta Lombok,Caroline Cunningham,5,Kenza Cafe was delicious and food had beautiful presentation. Lovely music and bright environment. Servings were more than fair and staff were friendly. Highly recommend. Danny our server was very friendly and had a wonderful smile. We will be returning for brunch tomorrow!
1393,ChIJjUIwWCuozS0RYMQ5nRsAdjg,Kenza Cafe & Restaurant Kuta Lombok,Taylor,5,"Amazing breakfast restaurant with all day breakfast! Their coffee is also incredible, some of the best I‚Äôve had in Indonesia. The big breakfast was very tasty and their fruit with yogurt was also very tasty. Highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast or lunch! It‚Äôs very popular, but the food still came fast."
1394,ChIJjUIwWCuozS0RYMQ5nRsAdjg,Kenza Cafe & Restaurant Kuta Lombok,Tri Haryono,4,"New design of Kenza Restaurant, calm and fresh look. The food taste excellent, but The price can't say cheap.
I tried order menu some Steak, it take more time so must be patient a lot, and meat a little bit tough even medium level.
Need more upgrade to make menu with picture so customer easy to imagine what they want to order. Menu with hard Printing or digital menu with picture is better beside menu with letter only."
1395,ChIJjUIwWCuozS0RYMQ5nRsAdjg,Kenza Cafe & Restaurant Kuta Lombok,Micheal,4,"The food is pretty good but the drinks aren‚Äôt consistent.  I liked the other location better when they were located across the street.  The sun coming in the big window made 25% of the seating area too hot to sit in.  Quality seems to vary depending on who‚Äôs working that day.  For coffee and juice, there are better options in kuta that aren‚Äôt as expensive.  It‚Äôs also super annoying when places like this only accept cash and don‚Äôt take debit card or QRIS for payments."
1396,ChIJjUIwWCuozS0RYMQ5nRsAdjg,Kenza Cafe & Restaurant Kuta Lombok,Tamar Arzoumalian,5,"Such an awesome vibe !!!
Amazing desserts! Must try the baked cheesecake & pandang cake. Such a treat to come here. Gorgeous & friendly staff plus did I mention air-conditioning üôåüôèüèΩ
Thank you to the beautiful team at Kenza cafe for welcoming us."
1397,ChIJw5KTqCyozS0RhHGn8S-Y_8s,KRNK Bar & Restaurant,Ophelie Chuffart,5,"We were blown away by the quality of the burgers. We got the dirty burger and the SMURF one (vegetarian). We devoured them. Everything was we perfectly cooked, from the bread, to the sauce, and to the patty.  We additionally ordered a giant salad (bunny bowl) which was excellent as well."
1398,ChIJw5KTqCyozS0RhHGn8S-Y_8s,KRNK Bar & Restaurant,Fatima AlMadhloum,5,"Loved the funky ambiance of the place. So casual and at first, it doesnt look like the food is good but OMG! One of the BEST pizzas i ever had. The KRNK friend chicken burger is also so good, not oily and just perfect."
1399,ChIJw5KTqCyozS0RhHGn8S-Y_8s,KRNK Bar & Restaurant,Mike Freijer,5,Yummy burger. Not so special pizza. Cocktails are also very nice here. Great music guys! Price of everthing is higher than surrounding restaurants. Overall very good food!
1400,ChIJw5KTqCyozS0RhHGn8S-Y_8s,KRNK Bar & Restaurant,Arya Ng,5,"The best Burger found in Kuta area! The Classic burger is so good. Patties is juicy, tender, and full of flavour. Yet the buns is so lovely just to eat it by itself. Don't forget to try the cocktail too! Get the bartender's choice for u! Keep it rocking guys!"
1401,ChIJw5KTqCyozS0RhHGn8S-Y_8s,KRNK Bar & Restaurant,Rupal,5,This place was very nice. We loved the food! Oh god the quantity of that burger was huge! I couldn‚Äôt finish it ü•≤ but it was so tasty!
1402,ChIJF8zcViuozS0RO57KylS77Ns,Le Too Much Restaurant World Cuisine & Caf√© Dessert,Lars F Clausen,5,"If you want a high quality food experience, then visit this restaurant. Remember Quality costs. Prices are in the high end, but worth it. Very tasty and nice colors. Each dish on different plates. We suggest cakes for desert, the cakes are a dream. The french owner is friendly and talk with the guests."
1403,ChIJF8zcViuozS0RO57KylS77Ns,Le Too Much Restaurant World Cuisine & Caf√© Dessert,Daniel Oliveira,5,"Very tasty food. Very friendly. We ate here 5 times during our month in Lombok and all 5 times were great. The owners are very friendly and fun people.
It‚Äôs right at the intersection in Kuta center. Probably that‚Äôs why we didn‚Äôt noticed the restaurant before while driving our scooters. As you have to be very concentrated on the road while crossing the intersection.
Definitely worth a try for anyone who likes quality food."
1404,ChIJF8zcViuozS0RO57KylS77Ns,Le Too Much Restaurant World Cuisine & Caf√© Dessert,Kunal K,5,"Le too much is an under the radar gem that offers an international selection of meals in a pleasantly quaint setting. I'm a fan of their lamb skewers and also the chicken tikka masala. In some ways it feels like a home cooked meal, even though it is plated in a highly professional way.

Having tried several of the restaurants in the area I return here day after day for a reliably delicious meal. The staff are extremely friendly and hospitable."
1405,ChIJF8zcViuozS0RO57KylS77Ns,Le Too Much Restaurant World Cuisine & Caf√© Dessert,Evan Greenberg,5,Amazing owners but even better food. I ordered the Lebanese chicken shawarma. All the flavors combined to perfection to create one of the best meals I have ever had in my life. I don‚Äôt often write reviews but this experience warrants it. Don‚Äôt miss out on a chance to dine here if you are in Lombok.
1406,ChIJF8zcViuozS0RO57KylS77Ns,Le Too Much Restaurant World Cuisine & Caf√© Dessert,Maria Grazia Ticca,5,"I love this place so much.
It's great quality food and so tasty. Prepared with so much love and fantastic ingredients.
The starters are a great opening to prepare for main and dessert.
I had a wonderful mixed starter and tofu tikka masala followed by some delicious desserts.
Everything here is homemade and so delicious.
The owner, Priss, is a wonderful host, and he will make sure that you leave with a smile on your face.
Overall amazing food and great atmosphere.
I can't wait to be back üòç"
1407,ChIJ1TWbTnXCzS0R9RF2wv4wTAU,Lombok Resto,Rezi Riadhi,5,"The mexican food is really delicious, but it took too long to serve your dishes. So don't come with very hungry stomach. The ambience is very good and cozy but no live music"
1408,ChIJ1TWbTnXCzS0R9RF2wv4wTAU,Lombok Resto,Mutia Hapsari,5,"Amazing view & tasty food. Best time to visit would be around sunset, so you can experience a one of a kind experience. Worth all the climb (they installed a lift btw)!"

1412,ChIJAfVb8BzCzS0Rj7j2Z0UIv2o,"La Chill Bar & Restaurant - Senggigi, Lombok",Deby Firmansyah,5,One of the best to enjoy the sunset.  This place is very good.  The food and drink are delicious with various choices.  The price is also still affordable.  Music is heard to add to the excitement of enjoying the afternoon before sunset.  The place is clean and tidy.  Toilets available.  Highly recommended if you visit Senggigi Beach.
1413,ChIJAfVb8BzCzS0Rj7j2Z0UIv2o,"La Chill Bar & Restaurant - Senggigi, Lombok",Cindy Fanny,4,"Right place for chilling, specially for sunset, you can see sea, mountain and sunset in one time. Food and beverage also affordable and have good taste. There a lot local people who offer merchandise or massage but it's okay you can refuse it. The staff is good."
1414,ChIJAfVb8BzCzS0Rj7j2Z0UIv2o,"La Chill Bar & Restaurant - Senggigi, Lombok",Iva Nu,4,Cute beach bar in Senggigi Lombok. Good vibes and friendly staff. Nice for drinks during sunset. We did not eat there cos the menu seemed a bit basic but price was ok.
1415,ChIJAfVb8BzCzS0Rj7j2Z0UIv2o,"La Chill Bar & Restaurant - Senggigi, Lombok",aya schrey,4,Really nice bar at the beach with delicious cocktails and food. We only had to wait a long time for the cocktails and 1 dish. But in general it was a perfect place to hang out

1417,ChIJ_3rk3c6pzS0R1VYGxY6Cxe4,The Hut Restaurant Kuta,Micheal,5,Fresh and delicious healthy food.  Super friendly staff.  The grilled chicken salad bowl is huge - i love it.  The juices here are phenomenal as well - pure fresh pressed juice no water added.  I love the ‚Äúgreen goddess‚Äù juice.   Coffee is also great here. I had a flat white and they made a seahorse picture with poured milk.  brilliant.  highly recommend.
1418,ChIJ_3rk3c6pzS0R1VYGxY6Cxe4,The Hut Restaurant Kuta,Jenn Rivera,5,"Have been here twice now (once at night and once during the day) and both times were on point.

The lava cake was oozy. The carrot cake was nice but the sauce is what really made it - could have double the amount!

Pita was stuffed full with very delicate shell and the curry was full bodied and flavoursome! We also got a mango juice (tangy) and a tea (hubby liked it, I didn‚Äôt).

Staff are excellent. Vibe is chill. Clean. Good wifi."
1419,ChIJ_3rk3c6pzS0R1VYGxY6Cxe4,The Hut Restaurant Kuta,Nicola,4,"Went to have lunch and the food was really good, big portions and really tasty. We ordered fish and chips and falafel sandwich and both was really really well made. We went back a day after to eat again.
The staff is really professional and helpful in everything you need ! Definitely a place to eat when in Kuta. Reasonable price for what you get.
Highly recommend."
1420,ChIJ_3rk3c6pzS0R1VYGxY6Cxe4,The Hut Restaurant Kuta,Shin Tan,5,"Wish I could dine here again but it was our last night in Lombok. Everything tasted good! We had pumpkin soup, classic salad, mango sticky rice and chocolate lava cake. The lava cake was extremely well made I was so surprised! One of the best I ever had in my life. Must try! I‚Äôm regretting not getting the curry but I wouldn‚Äôt be able to finish coz the salad portion is too big! It‚Äôs like for 3 servings. Please offer smaller serving in your menu so we can enjoy more of your food sir!"
1421,ChIJ_3rk3c6pzS0R1VYGxY6Cxe4,The Hut Restaurant Kuta,Yiorgos Ion,2,"So we had chicken pitas, tasteless nothing to feel, even mayo was with no taste..full of lettuce and cabbage but chicken was hard to find.. honestly this is not a pita guys! Better call it lettuce pita veg or whatever.. very disappointing.. for 85k overpriced for sure! The staff is nice so I give 2*
The environment is also nice put I can‚Äôt upgrade to 3*. Not recommended"
1422,ChIJ4Wkg-BinzS0RXKHAwG1pcXw,Laut Biru Bar and Restaurant,Amelia Ferrao,5,"This restuarant has a beach access, amazing view of the beach, mountains and horizon.

Its a very relaxing place, interiors are well done, the staff are very friendly, kind and helpful.

It was the 1st time I heard a sound of a Gecko and thought it was some alarm system for the staff. Don't worry the geckos are away from sight, they are part of nature."
1423,ChIJ4Wkg-BinzS0RXKHAwG1pcXw,Laut Biru Bar and Restaurant,ejha yudasukmana,4,"Such a pleasant place to spend leisure time with family and friends. At the bar's front you'll be served with a glistening beach view. Food and beverages are on friendly price, although for pizza and pasta lovers, you might not be pleased due to limited menu choices."
1424,ChIJ4Wkg-BinzS0RXKHAwG1pcXw,Laut Biru Bar and Restaurant,Reginald Evan,5,Best place to chill and enjoy the beach around this area. We ordered some fresh milk shakes then play by the beach. Tips: come around 4pm and you will find the locals with buffaloes passing on the beach in front of the bar. Magical experience!
1425,ChIJ4Wkg-BinzS0RXKHAwG1pcXw,Laut Biru Bar and Restaurant,Gabrielle,5,"Nice view!!!! The beach are lovely. The food not to bad. If you in the night pls prepare for the moaquitos.. And flies.

But the view when sunset was wonderfullll..

Love it.. Must come here"
1426,ChIJ4Wkg-BinzS0RXKHAwG1pcXw,Laut Biru Bar and Restaurant,Jenn Rivera,5,"Excellent spot for a bite, drink and relax after (or before!) a swim at this incredible beach.

Laid back and polite staff.

Stunning view over the white sand, the surf and, depending on your timing, hearding!

The pineapple cheesecake was like a cross between a cheesecake and a panna cotta. I dig it. I could eat too many of these!

Will have to go back to try the food.

There‚Äôs a little outdoor sink too to wash your salty hands off before digging in to your food and drinks, which is helpful."

As soon as I stepped in to the restaurant I was greeted with a nice and friendly welcome by the staff. They directly escorted me to table on the beach that is suitable for me. The menu had a wide range of options that I could pick from, and the staff gave me great recommendation's based on my preferences. The food was outstanding and tasted exactly like what you can get in Indonesia but even better!
Everything was made fresh and perfect, from the drinks to the food and even the desserts. I ordered vegan food, they gave me book of selection tempting vegan choices.
I found there was a beautiful art of the wonders of Indonesia in every corner and had story behind all artwork, the waiter brought me around the hotel and see the room.
If you're looking for a unforgettable dining experience, I highly recommend Bale Kokok Pletok Restaurant at Hotel Tugu Lombok!"

I can easily say this is the best restaurant on the island.
1437,ChIJW8TqgQbCzS0RYfj2LM01EUg,Square Restaurant & Lounge,Fabian John,5,"We came here by chance as the information on restaurants in Senggigi has been quite sparse. To our surprise - the food was really good! The rendang was tender and the Ayam taliwang was impeccable. The star of the entire dinner would be the sambal! Having it with our meal was like climbing a steep mountain, knowing the effort is worth the view üòÖ. The staff were very attentive and we appreciate the garlic bread on the house. A fantastic place for dinner if you are ever in Lombok. Plus point: it is right beside a big supermarket that sells WINE! Wine in Lombok!"

If you are in Lombok don‚Äôt miss it!!!"
1442,ChIJW8TqgQbCzS0Rk0lLUopdSpk,Asmara Restaurant & Lounge,oloifh,5,"Very nice food, partly European and Indonesian. Taste for European is very authentic and the taste is great. The service pay a lot of Attention and try to help immediately. I was sitting in the area further away from the street, therefore it was not very loud. However, if you get the area next to the street it might be relative loud.
The owners are from Germany as last information, maybe that is why European food is authentic"

Nearby, there is a good shop to buy gifts called Banyan, so it would be nice to go shopping before eating or going to this restaurant.

Greasy and not tasty curry with fish and dry tuna steak, though ok.Prices are average for the island tourists spots. A nice public library and pools table could be found at the back but if it's just for food its really not wow, though ok. Staff is nice ."

Jali Kitchen is a must! If your on Gili T - then make an effort to go! There's a reason why it's hard to get a table or dishes get sold out - because it's bloody awesome! They're food is very authentic.

We ordered the mushroom ravioli in creamy beetroot sauce - vegetarians eat your heart out! An assortment of other dishes, unfortunately due supply shortage, couldn't try the beef rendang - next time for sure!

They have a large selection of fresh fruit drinks, I went back multiple nights just to try an assortment. They're all so refreshing & mouthwatering!

The restaurant staff are very friendly in particular the manager - Yuri (young handsome gent behind the counter). I tried to order a dish that would only be ready much later that evening. The manager then offered to have the dish specially delivered to my villa and to my surprise it was Yuri behind the door! With free banana bread too! It was very nice of Jali kitchen to have it delivered so late and was a special request that night :)

I have said too much - I will let the pictures do the talking :D"
1448,ChIJgf7LiKngzS0RYM8rz0gXmoA,Jali Kitchen,Feirouz Ben Guirat,5,"This restaurant is really worthed a 5 star rating.

1450,ChIJgf7LiKngzS0RYM8rz0gXmoA,Jali Kitchen,Bea MC,5,"Ate here twice, really great service and the food is delicious. Price is affordable but suitable for the quality of the meal definitely.

Good I would recommend: Beef Rendang and carrot cake (one of the best). I ordered 2 starters, 2 mains, 2 cokes and 1 dessert for ¬£16. I didn‚Äôt like the chicken satay as the sauce lacked taste - better in London."

There are 4 very well-appointed rooms with amazing views to the ocean. Bed is very comfortable. Staff are so friendly and you can always chat with the owner. Just know that if you want your room cleaned, you need to ask. They do not want to intrude by knocking at the door at a certain time. Cleaning can be done between 9am & 3pm. Sunset is amazing!

Alberto and the staff are wonderful, very helpful, and cheerful people, who make you smile every day. They always have a moment to ask if you need anything or just to chat. They helped us with renting a bike, and Alberto even translated for us with the owner of the rental. They gave us a lot of tips for trips and safety on the road. The room was big and clean. The view and the pool are absolutely the best, same as the breakfast and every meal we've had there. This is our number one in this area. Thank you for everything guys."

Every dish we had at Amazing Lombok Restaurant was of exceptional quality and truly amazing taste! üòç pancakes with mixed berries and shakshouka became my personal favourites for a perfect breakfast before surfing ‚ù§Ô∏è
The burger and chicken parmigiana were also beyond any compliments üí´

The location in proximity to the beach, as well as marvelous, picturesque swimming pool are great additional reasons to visit ü§ó"
1458,ChIJG6Y01renzS0RtVHZNUrrn84,Amazing Lombok Restaurant,Ria Mawaddah,5,"It‚Äôs the cutest spot with amazing view and tasteful food. The service we received was so amazing and we will definitely be back again. They made us feel welcomed and gave us an amazing experience. If you are near Kuta or Serangan Lombok, don't hesitate to stay in their resort or just enjoy the foodüòé"
1459,ChIJG6Y01renzS0RtVHZNUrrn84,Amazing Lombok Restaurant,Pablo Cabrera,5,"Great venue with a beautiful refreshing swimming pool surrounded by green hills. Very complete menu, super friendly and professional staff. This is a mandatory stop if you come to Serangan"
1460,ChIJG6Y01renzS0RtVHZNUrrn84,Amazing Lombok Restaurant,Gayuh Asmara,5,Nice restaurant. Certainly a great option when you're in Serangan area.
1461,ChIJG6Y01renzS0RtVHZNUrrn84,Amazing Lombok Restaurant,Anna,5,"Amazing food in an amazing place ! Everything on the menu is exciting, and the quality is great ! Perfect place for a chill day : swimming pool, good food and games!"
1462,ChIJcRKMidbpzS0RnhkA2GggP5g,Verve Beach Club,Martiana Sipahutar,5,"This place is highly recommended to enjoy beautiful sunset in Senggigi. It has spacious parking lot. The sunset is gorgeous. When the sky is clear, you can even see Mt Agung in Bali, so near yet so far. The ambiance is nice and cozy, not too crowd, the music is fine, not too loud. The price is also reasonable. I enjoy my coconut drink and the beach and sunset very much. The softness of its dark sand is perfect."
1463,ChIJcRKMidbpzS0RnhkA2GggP5g,Verve Beach Club,Carol S,5,"A great place to relax, chill, and enjoy the view!
Really tasty food, super impressed that the menu price includes all taxes (no guesswork!) Unfortunately, the red curry was so delicious (& not at all chilli'd) we forgot to take a before pic. An easy location to get to, great service and variety of Indo & Western food, also a great cocktail menu and good selection of beer."
1464,ChIJcRKMidbpzS0RnhkA2GggP5g,Verve Beach Club,Andreas Bruchwitz,5,"We really enjoyed our dinner at Verve (Saturday night). The food was great, the cocktails were really yummy and didn't taste like petrol like they do in some other places. The atmosphere was chill and quiet. Staff and Service were great, they accommodated everything we asked for (even charged our phones). The sunset was amazing to watch from there. Prices are little higher than usual, but not too crazy (around 90-110k for food/cocktails). Definitely worth a visit."
1465,ChIJcRKMidbpzS0RnhkA2GggP5g,Verve Beach Club,Tina Salim,4,"The ambience was good, would be better if they played some music. The food taste could be improved. Overall nice place .."

1472,ChIJ21TzW2PAzS0RmEL3faL3GDA,Roemah Langko by Putera Lombok,Yuli Astuti,5,"Highly recomended if you wish to have a taste of local and Bali dishes. So you have to check if its spicy or not.

The sate rembige and ayam taliwang (both a little bit spicy) is good. But i looove the ikan bakar kerapu with bumbu jimbaran (no spicy, a bit savoury and a little bit sweet)

I love have they manage to maintain the old style vibes and the koi pond add the homey feeling. And you can also have a gathering here from 30pax to 100pax with spacious rooms. You can ask for baby chair if you need one.

The waiters also very friendly and quick responds.

I gave 4 stars for the food becoz, when i did my gathering for 30pax, some of the food taste a little bit too salty.

As for other thing, all was excellent."

The vibe felt like a laid back but fancy restaurant for special occasions. And the food is soo good. Some dishes are spicy and have a good kick but beware what you order if you cannot take spice."
1476,ChIJ21TzW2PAzS0RmEL3faL3GDA,Roemah Langko by Putera Lombok,David Dong,5,"A very nice place to eat to go with friends, family or colleagues. with an old dutch atmosphere that is still very well preserved."

For more than 10 years, we have fallen in love with The Lombok Lodge with its unique Hotel Concept. This hidden haven offers an exceptional level of luxury. You can overlook the shimmering turquoise ocean of Lombok‚Äôs beautiful Medana Bay. The property is maintained outstandingly, the rooms are extremely clean, and the overall atmosphere at the Lombok Lodge is one of tranquility, attention to detail, and happiness with a lot of smiles from the staff.

The dishes are delicious and vary from Indonesian to Pan-Asian and Western food. Every meal is well-balanced and is composed of sweet, sour, bitter, and salty components and a wide range of quality products. Can you imagine? They harvest organic herbs from their own organic garden. Chef Jiwa delivered stunning meals every day and took the time to personally visit us and check in to ensure our meals were to our personal preference. He prepared ‚ÄúRoyal Breakfasts‚Äù each day and wowed us with stunning 4-course dinners in the Flavors restaurant.

But also, the Italian Osteria for lunch can be recommended as a typical Italian Osteria where you enjoy pizza and pasta, and many other timeless classics of Italian cuisine, such as antipasti, salads, and delicious dolci.

We are still truly amazed by the top-notch hospitality. Needless to say, we look forward to coming heading over to this paradise again soon and would highly recommend this for people who are looking to switch off and recharge in heaven."
1480,ChIJPdh48BHczS0R0_jX7M8b9NY,Flavors Restaurant Lombok,Molly Routledge,5,"If you‚Äôre searching for an experience, as much as a place to eat, then Flavors is without a doubt the place to go. I booked the private jetty for my partner and we were truly spoiled. The staff were beyond lovely, the table setting was stunning and the overall environment was brilliant. And I haven‚Äôt even mentioned the food. We had the Lobster set menu and it was delicious! So fresh! As well as this, we got a visit from the chef himself. If you‚Äôre thinking about going, go!"
1481,ChIJPdh48BHczS0R0_jX7M8b9NY,Flavors Restaurant Lombok,Li Satryaputra,5,"Fantastic hospitality with 5-star location. Might worth the visiting lombok for this experience. The experience itself is highly personalized with great care from the well-trained staff.

Great quality food for special occasion."
1482,ChIJPdh48BHczS0R0_jX7M8b9NY,Flavors Restaurant Lombok,Giovanni,3,"Nice experience, but the food is not that good. I mean, the quality is excellent but the final result is not balanced. It is not wow, probably just ok. The staff is super nice and kind but definitely the overall experience doesn't worth the price."

1484,ChIJV3dzeAXCzS0RVrTOsPqfSng,Pasta Pojok,Fabian John,4,This place was recommended by our tour guide and what an unassuming place to get hand made pasta -- but it was truly amazing! I also read previous reviews that the thicker pastas were a lot better and I could not agree more. We loved the pasta so much we got it delivered to our hotel for lunch the next day! We also had their pizza delivered via Grab a day earlier and it was 10/10 hands down. Service was a little lacklustre at the beginning but once they warmed up to us - it got better. Perhaps a little fine tuning in service and a little touch of warmth to new guest would do the trick.
1485,ChIJV3dzeAXCzS0RVrTOsPqfSng,Pasta Pojok,Deby Firmansyah,5,"This place is highly recommended to try.  The food is very good from the pasta and pizza.  Drinks are also available a variety of choices, there is gelato too.  The place is clean and the employees are friendly too.  Clean toilets are available.  Prices of food and drinks are also still affordable.  The location is strategic because it is on the edge of the Senggigi highway.  The layout of the space is also very neat and unique."

1487,ChIJV3dzeAXCzS0RVrTOsPqfSng,Pasta Pojok,Christian Theodorus,5,Best pasta house in Lombok. You can order any pasta in this place. And also they home made pasta. So you maybe want to see what pasta you like before order it. The downside is the only temperature inside is warm. Also they forgot my pizza but is okay.
1488,ChIJV3dzeAXCzS0RVrTOsPqfSng,Pasta Pojok,Melinda Smith,5,"This place is amazing! Attention to detail, service and the incredible chef. The food is blissful, brilliant coffee and fabulous sangria.

1490,ChIJ9ZwNkgrBzS0RIVUrCT9DB6A,Panyawangan Resto,Roberto Rodrigo,5,"Amazing place!!! We stayed for 2 days in Lombok and we went both days to have the lunch. The quality is top and his owner speaks English very well due to he was living in Australia. Best spring rolls ever. The views from the terrace is awsome and there is live music during fridays, saturdays and sundays evening."
1491,ChIJ9ZwNkgrBzS0RIVUrCT9DB6A,Panyawangan Resto,Kandi Sekarwulan,5,"A perfect place to see the sunset from high place: you can see all Senggigi coastlines from here, they have a balcony facing right to the west. The place serves West Java genuine cuisine such as karedok, nasi tutug oncom, etc. Live music every weekend evening. To get here you need a strong vehicle, since it's situated on top of a hill and the road is steep."
1492,ChIJ9ZwNkgrBzS0RIVUrCT9DB6A,Panyawangan Resto,Dian Puspita Sari,4,"This place has a nice view and a bit secluded. A good place to hangout and enjoy some munchies. Sunset time is the best time to come. Their pizza and mayo beef risoles were yummy for Indonesian tastes, but they need to work out on their main dishes."

I can strongly recommend this place!!"
1494,ChIJo6Sqp9fpzS0RsM3gnBB75kI,Kayangan Restaurant,Ratu Kesuma Dewi,1,"Today I ordered kids Pizza for my daughter and it was like in this picture! Very very less meat / sausages even I said always without cheese üßÄ but they give us food which worse than warung!!!!! Price here is NOT CHEAP! AND EXTRA 21% TAX AND SERVICE CHARGE. DON'T FORGET ABOUT THIS!
I must say this was the worst PIZZA I ever ordered in my life even worse than small restaurant ü§£. Every Hotel I stayed was never given us such bad food! If the chef on the kitchen was professional enough to work in 4 star resort, he/she will never give a kids pizza like this which is look too stingy to serve for the customer who pays expensive price plus TAX! Dairy free pizza means if the customer do not eat cheese they must give more other things like more meat / sausages for example. I have long stay here for 3 weeks and I must say nothing special about breakfast and lunch. Today breakfast was also bad and sometimes foods in kids menu were too less portion like this pizza. My daughter loves to eat whole grain m√ºsli but today only cornflakes and no bubur ayam also since few days.
For the price this restaurant is not value for money. We also had long stayed in 5 star hotel in Bali and they gave us 10% discount everytime we eat lunch and dinner. And the food were all yummy and worth the price and portion! Good hotel must have a Good restaurant that's what I know."
1495,ChIJo6Sqp9fpzS0RsM3gnBB75kI,Kayangan Restaurant,mark dunbar,1,"Never got served, the waiter cleared both empty tables beside us. He totally ignored us and walked away.  I went and picked up a drinks  and food menu, and the waiter still ignored us. There was only one other table occupied so unsure what he was thinking. We gave up and left."
1496,ChIJo6Sqp9fpzS0RsM3gnBB75kI,Kayangan Restaurant,Daniela Lo Basso,5,"Had a lovely lunch for 2 people. And really good cocktails. Thank you Swerta, for taking care of us."
1497,ChIJo6Sqp9fpzS0RsM3gnBB75kI,Kayangan Restaurant,Alexander Helber,2,"Nice location but really sub-par restaurant just for the least discerning of tourists. Food ranged from nothing special over westernised to actually not tasty at all. Cold and old banana frittas with cheese on top. Prices are pretty steep considering the not great food and the slow service.

Not worth going to if you're not a guest of the hotel and just eating there for convenience"
1498,ChIJo6Sqp9fpzS0RsM3gnBB75kI,Kayangan Restaurant,Lia Andewi,5,"You get all your money worth spending in this restaurant. Food is good, view is even better!!!

you can have drinks here while enjoying sunset view, or why not also order some early dinner, price is not too expensive and great selection for kids menu as well"
1499,ChIJJ_FP0JSmzS0RjItk0YMrnGU,Aura Lounge & Bar Lombok,Lukas Sendlhofer,2,"I‚Äôve eaten in a lot of places around Kuta, this restaurant was by far the worst dining experience I‚Äôve had.

1500,ChIJJ_FP0JSmzS0RjItk0YMrnGU,Aura Lounge & Bar Lombok,Fab C,5,"Pricey but worth it to enjoy the 100% stunning views and laid back atmosphere  ... food excellent too. Will definitely return next time on Lombok. Also, the best fried rice I have ever eaten"

1502,ChIJJ_FP0JSmzS0RjItk0YMrnGU,Aura Lounge & Bar Lombok,Made Fajar Trisna K.,5,We can find the best spot to get some meals with a great panorama over here. The pool also very nice you can take an awesome picture which describe yourself. The parking lot was fine.
1503,ChIJJ_FP0JSmzS0RjItk0YMrnGU,Aura Lounge & Bar Lombok,Helen Stone,3,Really is a great view but I would recommend having a look with an afternoon drink rather then a meal. The food is way overpriced and really not that tasty. Service is good.
1504,ChIJkcLAy1CpzS0R4zCZKd41XGA,Rocksalt Restaurant,Chuanqi Li,5,"The burger is really really good! We were on a ‚Äûfoodie‚Äú tour on the last day of our Bali-Lombok trip and we are just eating our way through the Kuta Main Street from small street vendors to the well-known restaurants :D and even though I am not a burger fan at all, and being already quite full(after eating several things‚Ä¶), I still enjoyed the buffalo double burger, spicy and sweet. Meat is juicy, with lots of flavor, and quite a mount of black pepper to spice it up! Staff is nice, atmosphere is wonderful, not a typical burger place, more of a cafe feeling, which is very chilled."
1505,ChIJkcLAy1CpzS0R4zCZKd41XGA,Rocksalt Restaurant,Marina Ferreira,5,"Absolutely amazing food!

1506,ChIJkcLAy1CpzS0R4zCZKd41XGA,Rocksalt Restaurant,SM,3,"I ordered the buffalo burger and i was disappointed. The bun was little soggy and the flavor of the meat, without any seasoning, a bit overwhelming.  You couldn‚Äôt test the pickles neither the sauce. Just meat. Also for this amount of money (95k) in my opinion was too small.
The only good thing were the hand cut fries.
The place looks good too, but that‚Äôs about it..nothing special.."
1507,ChIJkcLAy1CpzS0R4zCZKd41XGA,Rocksalt Restaurant,G Lutz,5,Wow I had the buffalo burger fresh with cheddar and it was sensational. My partner had the chicken burger and he thought it was ok but the chips were good. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a good burger in Lombok!

also, the fish was wrapped in banana leaf but i fail to taste any of it in the fish. sad. sengiggi is really just a tourist trap and has the worst food i tasted in lombok.

oh, gave me a wrong drink too, only realized it after i tasted it"

We had the bruschetta, chicken cashewnut and the carbonara. Although I forgot to take a photo of most of it!

Chicken cashew nut is strong and goes perfectly with the accompanying rice. Carbonara was warm and filling - exactly what we were looking for! I like my bruschetta with a little acidity from vinegar or lime, but that‚Äôs a personal preference.

Local style toilet was super clean!

1534,ChIJh_L7NTlIzC0R0aRPMVYbWWU,Warung Menega,swee leng Tan,4,Good & delicious grill seafood. Service is good. This is a warung so don't expect high end ambience. They use coconut husk for fire so the food taste better.
1535,ChIJh_L7NTlIzC0R0aRPMVYbWWU,Warung Menega,Rahadiyan Narendra,5,"The OG of seafood resto still delivers! Strangely it was no one when we came at 5.30 PM, but at 6 PM more visitors starting to came to the resto. We ordered 1 kgs of grilled clamps & a portion of Baronang fish (grilled). Both were bangers! Very good, the jimbaran spices for the grill seasoning was on point! I really felt like i was dining at the shoreline of Jimbaran, really comforting. Price wise it was slightly more pricey than what they have at Bali, but considering the average resto @ Lombok, I think no resto could match the way they deliver their authentic seafood taste."
1536,ChIJh_L7NTlIzC0R0aRPMVYbWWU,Warung Menega,Ir Rusman Abu Samah,1,"The food is not soo delicious and thus I will NOT recommend this restaurant to those who is looking for the seafood!

The squid and prawns is not soft and too hard to chew!

Remember! THIS RESTAURANT DOES NOT ACCEPT CREDIT CARD!

1537,ChIJh_L7NTlIzC0R0aRPMVYbWWU,Warung Menega,Jurate Ramoskiene,3,"Probably the seafood grilled over coconut shells should taste like this, but not to our taste. It looked and tasted over burned, squid was hard, fish was dry. But the view is nice  and staff is efficient"
1538,ChIJh_L7NTlIzC0R0aRPMVYbWWU,Warung Menega,Ario Baskoro,4,"Good view, ambience and also a best spot to catch a sunset. The taste of the foods were tasty. However, it took too long for the foods to be served. But overall it was worthüëå"

1546,ChIJDQuRe9OpzS0RYGfNmh6ptjY,Warung Lombok,Mart√≠ Graells,4,Tasty grilled fish! The fishes are shown in front of the warung. You can juggle the price with the waitress and choose what fish you would like. Then they grilled in front of you. We got a big squid and a red fish for 130.000 IDR. It came with rice and vegetables. The whole meal was gluten free with no cross contamination because everything we ordered was grilled. We ate me and my girlfriend and we ended up full. We moved around with the motorbike to see other warung‚Äôs prices and these was one of the cheapest. Right place to have grill local fish!
1547,ChIJDQuRe9OpzS0RYGfNmh6ptjY,Warung Lombok,R V,5,"Great adress to eat local food and fresh fish. You can choose the one from the front of the restaurant. Then the fish is grilled before your eyes. The food is fresh and delicious. The plate is generous and the prices are very affordable. The host is nice and polite. Maybe the decor is not 5 stars restaurant but this is a must do for all travelers since you cannot eat better in whole Kuta ! I will come back with the same big pleasure , I really recommend Warung Lombok !"

Italy, thousands of kilometers away, but so nearby. Years ago, we were surprised to find this finest Italian restaurant in Lombok. You'll feel like you're in a typical Italian Osteria. As a European family that enjoys traveling and food, we pay attention to finding excellent places to wine and dine. This perfect spot is ideal to take a break from the sun. Chef Jiwa and his team do an amazing job with the food and have elevated the cuisine to such high levels. Every meal is a treat. and it's the ideal place with a fine selection of Italian, International, and Asian Cuisine. After being here several times, I'm still surprised to discover new little teasers, pizzas, kinds of pasta, and international dishes. On top of that, I'm in love with homemade bread. Excellent, exceptional, marvelous!
Honestly, such a place is so unique Therefore, the table is where the journey begins. And the journey never ends."

1575,ChIJJRd0YASpzS0Rk0nMWmbO2hM,Jiang Nan Lombok,Roya,5,"So unexpected, but on the roads of Kuta Lombok you find this incredible Sichuan cuisine that just deliveries bold flavors in every dish. I had to roll back home as we wanted to try as much as possible. If you‚Äôre around and like that kind of food, make sure to make a visit (or why not 2 or 3). Only downside was that you could smoke inside of the restaurant which wasn‚Äôt pleasant for us."

1591,ChIJ30H5lFGpzS0RSJm8Kb575t0,Keker Taliwang & Grilled Seafood,Swen George,3,"Food was mediocre at best. Taliwang chicken was tiny and everything else was just so so. The highlight was the Kang Kong.

I ordered the fried duck presto and the duck betutu that was the best I've ever eat.
The duck meat is very tender, doesn't smell rancid. I love sasak vegetables salad was amazing and huge portion.

The chef has decades of experience preparing dishes in high-end restaurants.
No doubt at all.

One thing. The staff really taking care about cleanliness. They never forget to remind the guests wash their hand very polite. Really appreciated and touch my heart.

Thank you chef Mr. Lalu Arifin to bring local food to the next level. This is not only a food. This is an art.

There are many choices of seasonings, from sasak to or Balinese spices, naturally maybe... this is a chef who has been poor at cruise ships and famous hotels for decades.
in terms of appearance, presentation, and really authentic taste, there is a different sensation from the spices that chef Arifin makes. yes maiq basically! by presenting the look and feel of a restaurant style, the prices offered are very affordable, like the prices at the fresh vegetables stalls, you can get more and the service. really recommend it, moreover the chef is nice to chat with, can get a detailed explanation of the menu served

check on bangkief jaim's youtube channel, for detailed videos or if you want other culinary references that are uniquely delicious and distinctive around Lombok #manganheb"

1613,ChIJvU7WmSQo1i0RF3D22xTf-w8,Melati Restaurant,Reyna R W,5,"Personally, for the high price they set up, the food still needs improvement but the garnish is alright. Still, I'm really satisfied with the ambiance and all the friendly staff. The place is more like a museum restaurant with antique stuff and paintings decorating each room. After I and my family finished eating we explored the room, especially the Sugar Baron Room which contains the big painting of Oei Hui Lan.

From the restaurant, you can visit the neighboring Vietnamese restaurant, SaigonSan, through this violet hallway at the back of the restaurant."

You can choose outdoor seating, indoor with chairs, or with carpet.The menu choices are many and varied, the prices are affordable, However, the vehicle parking location is limited, the service is quite long, if the restaurant is full of customers, your food may take 30 minutes before it reaches your table.I quite recommend it if the restaurant is not too crowded,If it's too crowded, I hope your stomach isn't too hungry."
1617,ChIJtx4r4iMo1i0R15KUvLtqSKM,Harmoni Cafe and Resto,Teguh Prayogo,4,"Service is very slow. Especially when we visit there, situation is crowded (Thursday lunch). Waiters & kitchen looks very busy. It makes service runs slow. Our orders are served very long time.
Taste is OK. Price is still make sense. Ambience is ok. But in rainy season, don't choose an open air tables.
If you have birthday, they will give you free items as a gift.
Parking area is limited. You will get free coupon for free parking when you pay at cashier. You can give the coupon to the parking man outside.
Payment : cash & card."
1618,ChIJtx4r4iMo1i0R15KUvLtqSKM,Harmoni Cafe and Resto,Septian Eka Putra,5,Good family restaurant. They served indonesian and chinese cuisine. The fried oxtail is too small for me but it tastes so good tender and juicy as well as the soup üôÇ
1619,ChIJW6JaHioo1i0RWrAyqCRYaLw,Javanine Resto,ilman ilman,5,"The restaurant served variety of delicious foods and drinks. Surprisingly, the prices were not that expensive. It also has ample indoor and outdoor space inside the restaurant. What I like was the speed of the staff providing our orders. The restaurant seems to be very crowded during evening weekends, so, you probably want to come earlier around 6pm for a dinner."

Offer various dishes from Indonesian cuisine and western cuisine. Portion for each meal is enough for most adults, there's also kid's menu so you don't have to worry if you bring kids.

Overall, a nice place for gathering."

Once their parking is full you have to park on Starbucks or Burger King and most of the customers are using cars. I ordered ribs as main course, I think it could be better. There is too much marinade and sauce, and the taste of meat does not exist anymore."
1625,ChIJZ8lmEZ4p1i0RSIgnomSYqZU,Latar Ijen Resto & Cafe,Brian Holiday,5,Chic restaurant with clean modern decor and great views.  Inside AC and comfortable outdoor seating.   Food is good- highly suggest and Mac n Cheese balls.  Coffee is average.   Overall great experience.
1626,ChIJZ8lmEZ4p1i0RSIgnomSYqZU,Latar Ijen Resto & Cafe,intan elysabeth,2,"Give Latar Ijen 2 stars just only to appreciate the valet parking service.
Booked table for six person since a week ago.
Two hours before our dinner the resto text us and said ""sorry our cheese cake is unavailable since two days ago"" ~~ like?!?! Why then you tell us by now?
After then we went to The Harvest to bought cheesecakes. We asked the waitress for cold mineral water and they gave us neutral one, and we told them that we want a cold one, they then took it again and came to us saying ""maaf air yang dingin habis, jadi kami kasih sama ini ya"" sambil menyodorkan segelas es batu.

Also below are the foods that I ordered.

1. Classic Grilled Bbq Beef Ribs

the sauce is extremely sweet I can't even finished it. 3/5

2. Spaghetti Beef Stroganoff

it's cold. It's not even warm. 3/5

3. Cheese Fries Crumble

It's cold. Mengheran. Dieng Plaza's 5K TNT fries is better than this one. 3/5

Will I recommend Latar Ijen to my acquaintances? No.
But if they or you want to come, it's up to you. You decide :)"

But if you want to combine the two menus, you will get 2 separate bills. The food is varied, but everything is classified as mediocre while the price can be categorized as expensive. The pizza we ordered, resembled bread with pizza-style toppings. While Spaghetti chicken aglio olio looks like fried noodle. Likewise, grilled chicken with matah sauce, truffle cheese fries, caesar salad, fried rice ""latar ijen"" and chicken karage all tasted ordinary. But the atmosphere of the room does look spacious and luxurious. This place is suitable for fans of instagramable places to eat. The atmosphere of the cafe on the 3rd floor carries an open air theme, which is also very interesting.  Service is polite but slow."
1628,ChIJZ8lmEZ4p1i0RSIgnomSYqZU,Latar Ijen Resto & Cafe,Pratomo Aji,5,"Nice restaurant with good ambience, especially for family or gathering. Foods were good & tasty.
Location easily to access, near central city of Malang"

The place is cozy with industrial theme.
So, the interior design is instagramable.

We ordered ox tail soup, ‚Äòkecombrang‚Äô fried rice, and alfredo pasta.
Great taste. üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
The portions for fried rice and soup can be shared with 2-4 people. So, it‚Äôs worth the price.

They have enough parking space for 10-15 cars.
Good customer service.
The ‚Äòmusholla‚Äô on the second floor is clean.
The toilet is clean with unique interior.
Recommended for big gathering, family dinner celebrations, or just for a cup of coffeeüëçüèΩü§©"

1631,ChIJkxQq8I-CeC4REe6NxQs3LxI,The Arbanat | Kitchen.Cafe.Lounge,cllyst79,1,"Honestly this place has a very nice building and interiors are very nice. But the service itself is not even decent. I ordered asem asem bola daging, the food looks very nice and i was really craving for this, but one thing was that i couldn‚Äôt eat spicy food for today for particular reason. When i ordered the food, ive asked the waiter TWICE wether the food was spicy or not, and the waiter has confirmed, that it‚Äôs not spicy, yes he confirmed it twice and i heard it very clearly about every single word that he said that the food ISNT SPICY, i believed it and gave it a chance. I have placed all my hopes for this food but when the food came, it came with tons of chili, it wasn‚Äôt even 5 or 10, it was more than 10. I tried to separate the chili from the soup but it didn‚Äôt do anything, this made me very dissatisfied. When the waiter had said that this asem asem wasn‚Äôt spicy AT ALL, and turns out it was very VERY spicy. The steak was also raw, and the sauce taste was normal, i wont even say its worth for my money. This restaurant is disappointing."
1632,ChIJkxQq8I-CeC4REe6NxQs3LxI,The Arbanat | Kitchen.Cafe.Lounge,Nizar Fahimi,4,Love the food and interior design. Service is also good. However be prepared to spend a lot here as its very pricey.

The staff is helpful and our experience here was great.
We only tried the desserts and snack.
The chicken wings was not so bad. But the desserts was great. My fave is the chocolate peanut bar one.
The orange juice is made from real orange, and it's so fresh."
1634,ChIJoeZs_BYo1i0R21YXNZrpir0,Hok Lay Restaurant,Pheronactus,5,"Sooo.... Let's just get to the point. This is it! Hands down best place if you crave for mie ayam. The place is so vintage, even just entering this place gave me chills. The food is super awesome and delicious (chef's kiss). I can't believe they serve lumpia semarang that has the same authentic taste as the original lumpia from semarang.

The food tastes so good. Like soo good, you guys definitely have to try them. The place is clean, and the food delivery is quick. They only accept cash payments. Kudos to Hok Lay Restaurant, kamsia!"
1635,ChIJoeZs_BYo1i0R21YXNZrpir0,Hok Lay Restaurant,Zeena Rimba,3,"The cwimie is bland, I don't enjoy it. The Lumpia sauce is sweet. The fosco and es pudding are nice.
This place is legendary and often has queue. But I don't enjoy the food, especially remembering there people waiting for the seat."
1636,ChIJoeZs_BYo1i0R21YXNZrpir0,Hok Lay Restaurant,Michael K,5,"The food we ordered, cwie mie and lomie, are really good. The cwie mie taste on the salty side with a good amount of white pepper while the lomie has a more balanced taste served with generous topping of chicken meat and sticky black sauce.

Both the servers and owners are attentive in responding to our needs.

Parking is on street side. Seating is quite limited, especially when it's visibly a favorite joint by many surrounding locals, given that it's been serving good food for quite sometime now.

Glad to have eaten there during my short stay in Malang."
1637,ChIJoeZs_BYo1i0R21YXNZrpir0,Hok Lay Restaurant,Raymond Valiant,3,"Comparing to a few visits to this restaurant, I must say the dishes are definitely not ‚Äúprime‚Äù and this eatery is not a four star worth. Not my recommendation so far. The noodles are dull, not to say it is bland. The fried rice was too oily. The spring was my biggest disappointment. The spring rolls lack the bamboo sprouts and shrimps, making them just a vegetable roll, not savoury anymore. The spring rolls sauce is also too sweet with no hints of fermented soy. The fosco has become too sugary with less chocolate creaminess. Other drinks are just syrup based, I found no use of reviewing it."
1638,ChIJoeZs_BYo1i0R21YXNZrpir0,Hok Lay Restaurant,Ariella Cahya,5,"A legendary place you should not miss when in Malang. It has been around since 1946, and the building still retains the original colonial style up until now. Don‚Äôt miss out their Fosco, Dutch-style iced chocolate served in a coke bottle. There is a hint of saltiness in it, which makes the drink super addictive. You might unconsciously order another serving as you just can‚Äôt get enough of its goodness. As for the cwiemie, it tastes rather bland to me."
1639,ChIJzS3RWp2CeC4Rq-6WRY3Fyi0,Madame Wang Secret Garden,Maria Wheelton,5,"Delicious cheap food. Staff were very helpful and accommodating to our large group.

I‚Äôd say this restaurant is quite unique, not just the interior layout but also the smell. It was like pesticide, unless I had olfactory hallucination. I very much appreciate the ordering system. Memorable!"
1641,ChIJzS3RWp2CeC4Rq-6WRY3Fyi0,Madame Wang Secret Garden,Phoebe Dhi,4,"The place is beautifully arranged with a shady garden, quite instagramable for today's generation.

The food is beautifully presented although the taste can't be said to be special. The nasi goreng rawon that I had today unfortunately was too salty üò¨.. (it was the third time we came here, previous one was better).

The toilet needs more attention to cleanliness. The staff works quite well."
1642,ChIJzS3RWp2CeC4Rq-6WRY3Fyi0,Madame Wang Secret Garden,Zulfikar Annur Ahmad,5,"The atmosphere in cafe is suitable for gathering with your friends, family event, or bring your loved one.

The food is above average for caf√® in Malang area. I only tried the sandwich and its taste good.

The place is also baby friendly as they have high chair and the overall caf√® is safe for children to play."

So disturbing when someone wants to talk casually."

In September 2021, we went there again.

The foods came in small portion so i think it is a bit pricey..
I think i would prefer to choose other restaurant next time.."

1654,ChIJLyHbq-Uo1i0RL5dhzEKgNHI,Taman Indie,Pingky Sudibyo,5,"Taman Indie Resto excels in serving delicious Indonesian traditional cuisine, presented beautifully to please both the eyes and the palate.

One aspect that stood out to me was the wide array of traditional foods and drinks available. From the refreshing Cendol to the comforting Wedang Ronde and the unique Jaser Tulungagung, Taman Indie Resto offers a variety of options to quench your thirst and explore the rich flavors of Indonesian beverages.

Another highlight of this restaurant is its abundance of Instagrammable spots. From the captivating views of the surrounding rice fields to the creatively designed interiors, Taman Indie Resto offers numerous opportunities to capture memorable moments and share them with others.

What sets Taman Indie Resto apart is the variety of dining options available. Whether you prefer dining indoors in the main dining room, enjoying the semi-outdoor ambiance near the kitchen, or opting for a gazebo beside the rice fields, there is a perfect spot to suit every preference. Personally, I loved the gazebo beside the rice fields as it provided a serene atmosphere and allowed me to enjoy the breathtaking view and fresh air.

Most importantly, the food at Taman Indie Resto exceeded my expectations. Their traditional Indonesian dishes were delicious, and the prices were reasonable for the quality and portion sizes offered. The staff members were friendly and helpful, adding to the overall pleasant dining experience.

However, it's worth noting that due to the surrounding open rice fields, there were some mosquitoes present, which could be a minor inconvenience.

The combination of delicious traditional cuisine, great presentation, numerous dining options, friendly staff, and cozy atmosphere makes it an outstanding dining destination. If you're in Malang and looking to indulge in authentic Indonesian flavors while enjoying a memorable dining experience, Taman Indie Resto is a must-visit."
1655,ChIJLyHbq-Uo1i0RL5dhzEKgNHI,Taman Indie,Wientje Tan,5,"First impression very traditional humbly welcome greeting of their staff.
Second surprise they send you the big canvas size menu list,
Third memorable moment when the food come with nice presentation , and of course tasty . We order sego ndeso, gado gado , es dawet, jaser (Jahe sereh/ ginger lemongrass).

Lots of nice spot for photo taking
One minus point: some flies interrupted our lovely lunch"
1656,ChIJLyHbq-Uo1i0RL5dhzEKgNHI,Taman Indie,Diana Kusuma,4,"Foods were good, we can taste the authentic Indonesian flavours. Nice location and very pretty (ethnic) decoration. Service wise was OK. One thing is too many mosquitos and insects due to the surroundings."
1657,ChIJLyHbq-Uo1i0RL5dhzEKgNHI,Taman Indie,Ida Ayu Shitadevi,4,"Ambience is okay. outdoor and indoor dining places are available. The green view is refreshing. The food can be better because they have such high prices for everything, my expectation was too high, i didnt get what I paid for. During holiday and weekend people should book ahead to dine in."
1658,ChIJLyHbq-Uo1i0RL5dhzEKgNHI,Taman Indie,sc chong,5,"Don""t miss this restaurant if you are visiting Malang. You can easily come to this place with Grabcar service.

1660,ChIJeXNmBKgp1i0RD0y9SNcSCv4,OURA,DN,4,"First time visiting this place today. The parking was not very spacious, so it was little bit difficult to find a parking spot. Coming inside, the ambience was great and the restaurant was actually very spacious. Since we went during weekdays, there were many available table to choose from.

We ordered salmon dishes, green juice, and a slice of cake. The salmon took quite a long time to be prepared. The waiter actually informed us that it might take a while, and I was agree to wait for extra 15-20 min. However the taste was not very special for me. It was good but I will not reorder it again in the future. Green juices was very refreshing - definitely recommend to order this! And the cake was supeeeer delish! We order strawberry yogurt cake. The sweetness was not too much and the tangy flavor from the yogurt just balanced everything. We even got ourself another slice for take away.

In conclusion, we had a good time in this restaurant, but we think that the service could be improved. It took a long time to call a waiter when we want to order - both from the table and the cake counter. Their product knowledge was also not so good when we ask for menu recommendation."
1661,ChIJeXNmBKgp1i0RD0y9SNcSCv4,OURA,Maria Peni,5,"Nice place to hangout with family or friends. The food is delicious but  the price is expensive comparing the portion.

The food is vary : western (steak), Italian (pasta, pizza), and Indonesian (rice with ox tounge or duck)

Many kind of beverage such as : coffee, tea, milk, beer, cocktail, mocktail, and many more.

Due to pandemic situation, no live music that usually happened on Saturday and Sunday."
1662,ChIJeXNmBKgp1i0RD0y9SNcSCv4,OURA,Hanif Najib,5,"Nice place, great staff. Had the tongseng saikoro, aglio olio escargot and apple rujak tea, all were delicious. The white rice was problematic at first though, it had crispy dried bits and a bug in it."
1663,ChIJeXNmBKgp1i0RD0y9SNcSCv4,OURA,Rudyanto Wijaya,4,"Nice place to hang out in great ambience Cafe at Malang. Cozy, elegant, clean. It is a good place to have  sip of good coffee and pastry. The pastry is great. The dishes is okay, the pasta we ordered is good except for the meat they used. I already asked what kind of meat they use, but it seem the waiter not know enough about cooking so we just try to order it. The pasta taste good, but sorry for the meat, I don't like meltique meat, it is my taste bud a bit picky about meat. For some who like it tender and taste good it is okay.
We only visit for a short time when we have short getaway to Malang and quite full on out culinary trip, so we don't order many dishes to evaluate the whole dishes. I saw they make the pastry in glass room so we can see the process, so nice."
1664,ChIJuR915Psp1i0R-Ye0uemH7z0,signora pasta malang,Ahyas Budi,5,"Authentic pizza. Probably among the pizzerias in Malang City. You can tell there's a good reputation here because the owner is Italian.
The service is fast, the price is also good. Overall just fantastic.
You can eat inside or outside on their terrace. The outside is suitable for those of you who smoke.
It's not a very big place but it feels comfy."

My first experiences with pasta were on the wrong places, so I have been under impression that pasta is simply not suited for my palate, but this one is.. deliciosa! The desserts are also delicious. I don't have sweet tooth, and the tiramisu is just in the right sweetness. Def my saved list."
1666,ChIJuR915Psp1i0R-Ye0uemH7z0,signora pasta malang,sella M,5,"I think this resto is one of the best italian resto in Malang. they have lots variant from appetizer, main course to dessert.

the ambience it self is more like house of an italian friend, decorated full of movies etc. quite comfortble tho.

the food are great! i tried their lasagna and bruchetta and i'm not dissapointed at all. the portion and the price are adjusted.
The coffee is also great.

would def get back to this place."
1667,ChIJuR915Psp1i0R-Ye0uemH7z0,signora pasta malang,Raymond Valiant,4,"I enjoy the pastas served here. The owner of this restaurant, an Italian gentlemen and also a Juventus fans, offers various pasta and pizzas to your choice. The pasta and the pizzas are prepared according to the local methods. I enjoyed the gnochis and chicken-permeasan based pastas. Some sweet desserts are also recommended here. The restaurant itself is designed to recreate an Italian ambience."
1668,ChIJuR915Psp1i0R-Ye0uemH7z0,signora pasta malang,Winston Sanjaya,5,"Get to know this restaurant from a friend.
Feels homie.
I ordered spaghetti carbonara & garlic bread.
I dont know if its because the fact that the chef are original Italian ( and also a Juventini ) , when the spaghetti come , its unbelievably fragrant~
The taste are not strong, the texture of the spaghetti are just PERFECT~
The portion are just 'fit' right for one person.
The Garlic bread are also way more fragrant than those 'franchise' brands.

Homie, authentic, calm, all the waiters are very very nice üíõüíõüíõ
If you love pasta and pizza, i think this place is a MUST to visit and try. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

I would say Hungry Kitten is comparable with those steak restaurant at higher end establishment. They do serve proper steak, sometimes they change their menu on monthly basis so you'll have new taste to try. Look for their dry aged cuts and fresh cuts, your taste bud will fly to the moon."
1670,ChIJC4tLZgMo1i0RId3vtVAfKh8,Hungry Kitten Restaurant,Ve Momo,4,"Good atmosphere, we choose indoor room and it's really chilly. Staff is really friendly and nice but honestly their food can be better, especially the steak.

Their mash potatoes and corn is good. We order the meat to be medium well but they come in various maturity level. Some well done, some medium some medium well. But honestly it's still passable. Also too bad some sauce is unavailable and even worse the Tabasco is not in stock.

Overall is okay experience if you want to have a good chitchat with your friends and family."
1671,ChIJC4tLZgMo1i0RId3vtVAfKh8,Hungry Kitten Restaurant,Audrey Sevyana,5,"Their steaks are surprisingly very good!!!! My steak had perfect doneness and it was juicy even though I tried the regular one. Definitely will come back! No wonder it was packed with customers and I was suggested to make a booking prior to my visit. The ambience was good, but surprisingly  didn't reflect the steak price and taste which resembles a nice steak house. The place was more like on the 'cheap side' whereas the steak and service was more like an expensive steak house. The building was woody and casual, with open windows, no aircon, and  closed-to-one-another tables..."
1672,ChIJC4tLZgMo1i0RId3vtVAfKh8,Hungry Kitten Restaurant,M Nurwiseso Wibisono,5,"One of the best steakhouse around Malang (and sadly there are only few good ones). The place itself is themed close to a rustic barn theme. Parking space is good. Sadly the place itself is not that big (and abit hot inside, i guess outdoor is better)

Ordered the jack and jill's platter. The smokiness of the steaks is off the chart (really tastes good), even tho most of the menus are chef's cuts. Even the chicken is smoked well. Portionwise, it is most likely 3-4 person (me and my wife really really feel full just by the platter). Pricewise, it is quite expensive but as always worth the price.

If you are craving for steaks (moreover wagyus) this place is perfect for you!"

We arrived at 6 PM and directly order some food from starter to mains and some dessert.

Two of our dishes are to salty, we informed the staff about it, cause it is really really salty. Even we ask our relatives if is it normal for locals to eat such salt level?

Other meals taste ok but nothing special.

The plush point is the interior, what a great place for hosting  events , business lunch or dinner cause the interior is so amazing, jaw dropping.

We can choose the sauce for kolobak, either sweet sour or saos inggris. Generous portion for medium size should be enough for 3 persons. Bistik sapi was a bit uncommon, because they use sweet & sour sauce, just like fuyunghai. Nai goreng Hongkong was delicious, not too salty & oily, generous portion enough for 2 - 3 persons."

It is an old tasty dishes with quiet reasonable price.

The only bad thing is on the parking lot. You can only park on the road side and it is limited. However, there is a parking guy who will help and keep the limitted parking lot for restaurant's guess."

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I indeed asked them 3 times to follow up with the table number. But for some unknown circumstances the staffs were to busy to follow up.
Maybe I would dare to go back there again, and try out their food. Hopefully a better experience next time."

We ordered Steamed Rice, Mun Tahu, Bakmi Goreng Ulang Tahu, Brokoli Cah Polos, Kakap Asam Manis, Kuping & Usus Babi, Es Sehat, Iced Teas, for 4 adults + 1 child, and still had leftovers. Everything was tasty.

PRICE
Absolutely value for money for the quality. taste and portion. Overall price is about half the price in similar restaurant level in Jakarta/Bandung. The menu book shows the prices, not just photos.

SERVICE
Quick and no fuss no frills table service.

ATMOSPHERE
Big room, big tables, with ample walking space. Minimal decor, nothing too ostentatiously ""Chinese restaurant"". No annoying background music. Toilet is clean, not smelly, has toilet paper and sink.
The only thing that I hope they would improvr is to have more AC. For such a big room, there was only 2 AC units (if I recall correctly) and it was definitely not enough for the restaurant air to be cool.

PARKING
Parking in front of the restaurant available but very limited. However, there is a parking attendant who will assist you to park in available space around the restaurant.

However, there are some notes that I would like to say about the food: 1.) The butter Escargot was still a bit too chewy for my liking, but it was very well seasoned. I wonder why they did not give us small fork for the escargot. 2.) I couldn‚Äôt manage to finish my Australian Sirloin, because there was a strange bitter taste from the meat. I ordered medium and the meat inside wasn‚Äôt really juicy. At first it was okay until halfway of eating it. I thought it was coming from the sauce, because all other side dishes tasted nice, but it turned out that the bitter taste was coming from the other edge of the meat. Such a pity, I could have enjoyed it. I am a little bit disappointed for this dish. 3.) Surf and turf was nice, both the meat and the shrimps were very well seasoned. As well as the potato croquettes. 4.) I love their es krim goreng (fried ice cream) and it was quite a big portion, serves two people. The coffees were nice too.

I spent 600k for two persons. Anyway, perhaps I would be back in the future to check the other dishes (I hope my steak won‚Äôt turn bitter again next time). FYI: there are no complimentary bread / hard roll."

The menu is mostly the same, and slightly overpriced. The taste is good. The minus point this time was  we ordered 3 meals, only 2 were delivered to us. We waited for quite long before asking the third meal, the waiter gave lighthearted response and did not return to confirm whether our order would be made or canceled. Until we paid the bill, the same waiter did not give any confirmation or apology for the incovenience. Such a disappointment."

The overall taste is not very strong and a bit bland for my taste. The meat in the rawon is so plump and juicy, kinda worth the price. Just wish they could use more seasoning"
1721,ChIJT7t7ejko1i0RCmxnudeWG1w,Rawon Rampal,Teguh Prayogo,2,"I don't know why this rawon restaurant is very expensive and become legendary.
The service, cleanliness, taste, location, Ambience, rooms, parking area are not worthy comparing with the expensive price. All the menu starts from 50K. Maybe if you go there with your friend, you can share the rawon and add rice.
Their uniform is not good for a legend rawon restaurant that established since 1957.. wow it means 65 years. But they don't learn how to adapt the market change.
Taste is not special. The only one i like is the sliced empal. Rawon is rather liquid.
It's rather difficult for cars to park."
1722,ChIJT7t7ejko1i0RCmxnudeWG1w,Rawon Rampal,Ifka Yonatan,5,"I'm not a local but I think this is a legendary food depot. Specialties in Rawon.

Amount of beef are marvelous and the beef itself quite tender. Easy to dissolve. Rawon soup also taste authentic full of spice flavours.

Place not really a fancy place. No AC. Small parking area. Table also not much.

The ice tea taste funny. Taste like Vodka mixed with iced tea. Perhaps they didn't clean the glass properly.

Price wise moderate to expensive. Unlike regular Rawon which usually ranging from 20k-30k IDR.

Give it a try tho"
1723,ChIJT7t7ejko1i0RCmxnudeWG1w,Rawon Rampal,Alex Prima,5,"This restaurant offers you an authentic taste of rawon. It's a bit pricey though for freelance worker like me. However, the food and its historical value are the main attraction for me."

The others are relatively expensive but still worth it with the tasteüëçüèª. I think they have to consider about the price of rice & tea. Or for buyer, better you buy by delivery order because you can avoid the crowd inside the restaurant and saving money for expensive rice & teaüòÄü§≠.

They have second floor but i don't recommend using it because the stairs looks ""dangerous"" and not comfortable.

Parking area is challenging enough. Location is ok.

Service, attitude & hospitality from employees could be improved for better.

First disappointment is we got 3 round tables. Even though the purpose of the reservation is to get 1 long table together, so we can chat with each other. If they are separated, it reduces the essence of the reunion.

The next disappointment, the food station closest to our table was deliberately not refilled when the food ran out. I did file a complaint, but it seemed to be in vain, so food collection was concentrated in the middle of the restaurant. With long queues. Can you imagine, we are having bukber with the children and have to go back and forth to get food.

The restaurant seemed less prepared to receive a large number of guests. Atria Hotel class should be familiar with conditions like this, but in fact the service is disappointing.

Not all you can eat, the food station is more often empty/runs out. Remember, we are not here to eat for free, we pay according to the services you offer. Never mind food, plates, spoons, forks, glasses, bowls are scarce.

Setting up a place to the waiting area and lobby (exit the restaurant area), but not matched by qualified service. Hopefully it can be fixed in the future. To be balanced with the stars pinned on this hotel."

I ordered Korean fried chicken, fish & chips, Dori cobek sambal Jardin, Elote, Jardin 24 hrs ribs, Classic Bolognese Pasta and Matt's Meat Pizza. The jardin 24hrs rib is no wonder it's a favorite dish.  It tastes delicious and has a soft and tender texture.  The pizza is also crispy with fresh and delicious toppings. Other dishes are no less delicious. This restaurant has a large parking area and a relaxed atmosphere and good layout.  Anyway it's amazing and worth a visit."

And the portion is huge, u can never find another len ban with dragon King's size! Its more than enough for 10 people. And it doesn't stop there, i mean the smoked duck breast, the seabass, the fried prawns thats not greasy but sweet and savory at the same time!

Unfortunately, if you want a spa, you can't for the reason that there is service in other rooms, that's still an estimate from the receptionist. Really, even though I wanted to go to the spa at 8 in the morning, it should have been open, but apparently there were no people at all. He said he would call when it was finished. Until 12 o'clock they also didn't call, until finally checking out I didn't have time to spa."

1785,ChIJBexXh0Ap1i0RmRe0wKdjaqo,Nine House Kitchen Alfresco,Yohan Tan,4,"Located in a 3 storey private building, has basement parking lot and provide vallet service aswell.

The resto is located on the 3rd storey so you can choose outdoor seating to feel Malang's cold breeze.
The vibe is so nice with pretty architech building design.

Service, can be better.. we found it hard just to call the waiters. But the service after that was fast.

Food, it was all ok, not bad but also can have some improvement here and there. Particularly on the texture of Risotto, it was over-cooked and became more towards congee.
Also.. I asked for pink-tuna topping as shown on the picture menu, and end up over-cooked tuna on plate.

Beverage, not that special.

Will I comeback? Maybe, I didnt try the steak tho"

1790,ChIJoWe0rxco1i0RlKMAKt29HJ8,Rawon Nguling Restaurant,pahaqi,4,One of the busiest legendary restaurants in Malang. Rawon smells so strong -in a good way- but somehow tastes super light to my palate. Rice is too much for me; absorbing the broth that I should enjoy more. Dine-in experience is not that pleasant due to the hectic ambient.
1791,ChIJoWe0rxco1i0RlKMAKt29HJ8,Rawon Nguling Restaurant,Liem Eng Liong,5,"This legendary restaurant does serve very delicious rawon.  The meat is tender, juicy, soft and absorbs the gravy seasoning.  Really great food.  The side dishes are tripe, spleen, empal, tempeh and perkedel.  I tried spleen and perkedel.  The perkedel are very tasty, perfect to combine with the rawon.  The spleen is also fresh, the seasoning tastes good and the size is big.  Everything is satisfying.  The price of food here is quite reasonable.  Worth a try for rawon fans. Unfortunately the parking area is small, the dining room is not air conditioned."
1792,ChIJoWe0rxco1i0RlKMAKt29HJ8,Rawon Nguling Restaurant,octa,5,"One of legendary local culinary that you need to visit once at least if you visit Malang. Nasi campur is the one I always looking for. I am not a fan of rawon, but I think they serve one of the best authentic Rawon in Malang. Perkedel and mendol are also good. No wonder this place always crowded even if their price quite expensive for serving traditional local food."
1793,ChIJoWe0rxco1i0RlKMAKt29HJ8,Rawon Nguling Restaurant,Rheine Adithia,5,"""It has been 3 weeks since I came here, and the taste is still lingering in my mouth"" - thats what I always said to my wife. Their rawon was really really great. They're well known for their rawon since a long time ago. They serve 3 kind of rawon if I'm not mistaken. Kikil, tail and meat. When you order the kikil or tail, be aware of their portion. The portion can be eaten for 2-3 person,and if you choose kikil or tendon, it doesn't have any meat in it. So if you rather eat meet just order the single portion meat rawon. They will give you a plate of fried organs and other kind (lungs, brain, tempeh, potato fritters), I didn't eat any of the organ because of my ""scare of cholesterol"", but the babat looks appetizing. I do get one of their perkedel or potato fritters and it contains meat in it. The salted egg will not be on the menu, so you need to ask the waiter/waiterrsses for some ""telor asin"". Will definitely go back there again if I go the Malang in the future."

Tagliatelle and lasagna are my fav
Penne with capsicum, i think it's kinda weird, but it's okay.
No complaints abt the food from my kids.
They love their pastas &  fish n chips.

The ambiance is good, the place is nice and i loved it so much. For sure, i want to go back there, but the problem is with the waiter, only one waiter.

He took my husband unfinished bread on the plate without even asking him if he had done or not yet.
Just bcs he was texting, but it doesn't mean he is done eating.
We dont feel the waiter hospitality to us.
He seemed like tired/ bored/ wanted everything done asap or maybe having a bad day, but sorry, it's not our problem.
Other waitresses are nice & welcomed us.

The waiter (only one) manner & hospitality need to be improved, and the bread is 45k before tax."

The nasi pecel is their most favorite menu here, this cuisine is also the one that give this place its legendary reputation. Nasi pecel is a local Jawa Timur cuisine, consisted of rice with peanut sauce and other topping as you like (fried egg, tempe, mendol, chicken, satay, empal/beef meat, etc). I really like the nasi pecel, the peanut sauce's taste is excellent. Would love to come here again. My family tried other menu as well, nasi campur (mixed rice) and nasi liwet, and their taste were amazing as well.
The staffs were very busy, professional, and polite. They will help tou bring you what you want.
The place, eventhough rather simple, brings some old atmosphere somehow. Maybe because it is located in a once famous street corner in Malang. Several buildings in the area are still preserving old style theme. Really recommended place to visit and dine."

To order, we have to stand in line. We can either select from the list written on the wall or simply choose from the large variety of food presented behind the counter. Service was friendly from the various of servers we encountered.

The sego pecel is easily recommended as it's tasty and aromatic -with kencur flavor- served in generous portion. The fried paru on a stick is really good as it has the authentic taste with the right chewy texture, not too hard nor soft. Brings nostalgic moment from my childhood days eating paru goreng. The perkedel is also flavorful, filled with soft textured mashed potato.

During my visit, I was initially concerned as the first floor seating was all full. Turned out there were plenty more seating on the second floor. Parking is on street side"

1855,ChIJHfXrxawp1i0RfEJsfwjSuVU,Rooftop Maxone Malang,Aquilla Zura,2,"Food is not what it used to be. The process took a long time, at first I ordered zuppa soup, after 15 minutes+ I was notified when it was finished. In the end, I ordered something else, but it didn't take long, even though I only ordered fried rice, toast, and chicken pop, the food didn't even come warm. Maybe the staff has been reduced? If you wait a long time but it's still delicious, in my opinion it's okay. This toast is just a little burnt, even on the outside it's not crispy, it's filled with very little chocolate, it's like buying leker on the side of the road, just rubbing the chocolate, luckily there's a lot of cheese. Buy sesame chicken, only get a small fried chicken fillet, nothing at all. The fried rice also has no taste at all. Those who served were confused and panicked and rushed home. It wasn't 3 o'clock when I was told I wanted to close, so I was told to pay, even though if I'm finished asking, then it's okay to pay, fix the employee has to go homeüòπ."
1856,ChIJHfXrxawp1i0RfEJsfwjSuVU,Rooftop Maxone Malang,Maulfi Candra,5,"Nice place. If you want to swim here, you just need to go to the receptionist, the price is 50 thousand and you already get towels and drinks. The swimming pool is small. Good for photo spots."

Such a lovely home-cooked meal: Fried chicken, spicy fried eggplant, sauted bean sprout. I love the sweet soy sauce with chili as well. Their service were also fast. I mean, seriously I've ever gone to restaurant that devoid of guest but still they took so long to serve the food and drink. It's quite unfortunate the coconut ice taste less sweet to me, but definitely would love to go back"
1859,ChIJ5ZJbO8kp1i0RXoNvnELX2aw,Ayam Goreng Remaja,octa,5,"Surprisingly one of the best sop gurame sayur asin in town. The fish is very fresh and moist with good sambal too. Not only mentioning that, the fried gurame, kangkung, chicken, and orak arik udang are also very tasty. The price is also quite reasonable, but the resto is quite underrated. You should try if you like chinese food."

The acidity of mayonnaise must be controlled. So far, I have four stars because this place has a good menu for sharing. Please recommend some unique beverages to refresh the mouth from the smoke taste.

The waiters must smile at the customer. I thought they were unfriendly, so please improve your service. The price is not high.

By the way, your door is useless and make confuses customer"

I've order Smookin burger (if im not wrong), tasty burger, combination between Smookin beef and the sauce was good. But the beef bacon little bit overcooked so makes the texture little bit rubbery. And the bun so soft, it's absorb the sauce and make the bun sloppy and wet. But so far so good.
Oh i ordered lemon tea, honestly that's the best lemon tea I've ever tasted in the town."

Porridge and Sapo Seafood was good and apparently the porridge become my favorite when I'm not well and prefer to eat plain porridge. Even though it's says plain porridge doesn't mean its bland. It's flavourful and you could really taste the stock they used to make it. Good for friends and family dine in or even romantic dining, take away is possible, service was great, pay with credit card is possible and you could actually order food online from here with go-jek when you couldn't come but you want to eat something from here."

What I would like to highight is their health protocol. Ta Wan has contactless order system. Guests simply scan QR code available on each table, browse menu and order food they want. Very convenient!

Before my food arrived, one of the servers came to my table with a small metal container where the cutlery was and hot water. He poured the hot water into the container before my eyes."

Also they fried the pork well with good seasoning, not too salty. Other menu is pork rice that is my girlfriend favorite. She called it comfort food. The taste is not too tasty and a little bit tasteless in my opinion. But this place worth to try."
1894,ChIJ2VESQhko1i0RvsGFO1Njdxw,Depot Mie Sawahan,Ifka Yonatan,4,"A Chinese Depot serving Chinese food. Although the name stated a noodle house but they served quite versatile menu of Chinese food.

I tried it speciality Mie Pangsit and a regular Chinese food Tamie.

Taste quite good. Everything prepared accordingly.

Tables not much so when it is a dine time it gets crowded and a lil bit difficult to find a seat.

Price wise moderate. Give it a try."

1897,ChIJ2VESQhko1i0RvsGFO1Njdxw,Depot Mie Sawahan,Timothy Immanuel,3,"Very underwhelming food, a bit bland, and more expensive than usual chinese food. The name included ""mie"" or noodle, but the noodle menu itself was very disappointing."
1898,ChIJud3Af-cp1i0Rvan95AX8Ze8,Baegopa? House Of Hungry Kandang Malang,Tiara Permatanisa,5,"A great place to eat chicken katsu in the city! They have kinds of katsu and side dishes like french fries, spaghetti, etc. Price is okay. Portion is huge! So be careful while ordering. But if you left with leftovers, they can packed them for you.
The place is big, bright, a lot of dining areas."
1899,ChIJud3Af-cp1i0Rvan95AX8Ze8,Baegopa? House Of Hungry Kandang Malang,M Nurwiseso Wibisono,5,"A great place to have katsu around malang! The place is spacious (also the parking lot is ok). The menu itself is limited to chicken katsu, spaghettis and riceboxes. But the main selling point of thos place is the sauces (well, no place like this at malang and it tastes good).

There are improvements such as kids playground (small but at least they tried), and photobooth. Theres also food stalls such as ice cream (different brand but taste good).

This place is usually full by lunch/dinner time. So best come early or avoid those times."
1900,ChIJud3Af-cp1i0Rvan95AX8Ze8,Baegopa? House Of Hungry Kandang Malang,Faris Lafito,5,"If you're hungry, then you come to the right place.

1901,ChIJud3Af-cp1i0Rvan95AX8Ze8,Baegopa? House Of Hungry Kandang Malang,Icang J,4,"The portion was quite big, if you were planning to try another feast after this you better divide it into two portion, even the medium one was big, so you can go for the rice option for the small portion."

Quite affordable, taste delicious for quick and easy meal, chicken and pasta-based. Chicken was very tender. They also have rice bowl. Meals are definitely kid-friendly, the place is also kid-friendly with small yet cute playing area. But the beverage option isn't much. Would always suggest to come to this eatery for a quick and tasty meal."

Overall taste good especially the gurami krutuk..tahu petis is also good choice as snack..mango sorbet is nice but the cappucino is a bit dissapointing..the price is above average..it cost 285k for all the above menus (each carps are in half portion)"
1904,ChIJWZ9inhco1i0RHl7iMM_wC-8,Ikan Bakar 52,George,5,"We visited at around 5pm, wasn't busy yet. I ordered Daging Lada Hitam which is like a pepper beef stir fry. It was good but a little too sweet for me. We had Bebek Rica Rica which was duck with a very spicy, quite dry sauce. I liked it very much. We also had Bandeng Bakar Krutuk which was a ""Milkfish"" with a spicy (really spicy! ) sauce and sliced mango. This was my favourite dish, just the combination of it all made eat bite full of intense flavour."

1908,ChIJmwVTn_8p1i0Rpr_hePSiJcQ,Loteng Teppanyaki Bar,Auting The Explorer,4,"the restaurant is located in the middle of the city of Malang and easy access because it is on the main road.  Late lunch is very quiet so it's comfortable for a large family to eat.  the food is quite good, only the drink portion is too small for non juice, but there is free flow ocha so it is quite comfortable.  good service even though the food came a bit long, the taste was quite good and the price was more suitable for medium high visitors class.  The variety of food is quite a lot.  it is a pity the toilet is not clean even though tissue is available.  enough parking space for 3-4 cars"

They provide free flow rice and sambals, with four different types of sambals. You can also book the place if you will come in groups. They also serve take away orders. You may sit on the chairs or just do the lesehan. The place is quite clean.
If you come in groups and eat buffet, you can order the fruit cocktail, which tastes fresh."

I really like the place decorations and how it make me feel calm inside the garden. I really really like the 'sambal' !! You should come and experience the greatness yourself. There's also restroom and prayer rooms here. You can find kerepek/snacks/jajan here and also ice cream. Oh ya you can also add for me the sambal here. :) There's also a pool of small ball for kids here.

The dining area is pretty big, it offers an unbeatable day view of lush golf range and pool. Once seated, you wouldn‚Äôt want to leave. Food was pedestrian, while the service and atmosphere were all good. The price range is a bit on the steep side for Malang standard, but it‚Äôs worth every single penny. This is a family-friendly place too, as they have a playroom to keep your kids occupied."

First, I guess they won't make a good coffee since it‚Äôs not their specialty, but turnouts the espresso I‚Äôve ordered is way so good. They got a lot of menus, so I suggest you ask what‚Äôs favorite or recommended cuisine based on your preference (Asian or Europe-based menu). Another thing I appreciate is the hospitality, the waiters know how to serve the guests properly üëçüèª"

1923,ChIJNyppV5wp1i0RVu-zROxLu4A,Djati Lounge,Sarah R.,4,"Well, well... what can I say. I have been coming here every now and then since 2015. They were very good for once. And I‚Äôve always found myself coming back for the views and the vibes, never disappointed. If only the food quality and cleanliness (the floor, and most of the woods used for the interior weren‚Äôt as polished as they were used to be, and forgive me for minding such small details) did not decrease so significantly, they would still be worthy of the 5 stars review. But hey, it‚Äôs probably due to the pandemic. And probably they should stop changing the menu, actually they‚Äôve replaced so many good stuffs that they had once in the menu with new stuffs that were actually I have nothing really good to say about the taste nor the presentation... just meh. Still love the vibes though.

PS. Do not expect too much with the food, however this is such a perfect place in Malang for having your cup of tea or coffee (no happy hour, sadly, they only have beers. I wish they sell good wines)"

Food is okay as the chicken & cous cous came with apple sauce which is not a good combination.

payment can be by cash or debit."

You can also order family style dish to share. The atmosphere is great. I'm glad that everytime we visited the restaurant there were not too many people smooking inside the restaurant. They have both traditional and modern seating area. Yes, they do take credit cards."

All food and ingredients are exceptionally high in quality and definitely satisfying. You can find several types of beef from Wagyu, Australian beef, American beef, marinated beef and many others. My favorite is definitely the wagyu beef and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you to bring some of those wagyu beef to your grill. You can also find seafood, chicken, vegetables, mushrooms, kimchi, desserts, free-refill drinks and much more at their self-help bar. Their sauces are absolutely bomb especially the spicy sauce! I already visited this place 3 times and their service is getting absolutely better each time I went to eat here. Restaurant with delicious food and good service like Cocari really deserves the recognition among food lovers"

The concept of eating a buffet for  90 minutes initially made me doubtful. Vegetables, meatballs, meat, chicken which is always full, 90 minutes are more than enough to enjoy the food served.

I love the 3 kinds of sauce that corica provides. Grilled sauce, hot sauce, hot sesame sauce. No doubt I will invite more friends and relatives to dine here.

Love you cocari"

1962,ChIJs9mrhcoxMTAREPUbQbT53BU,"Miramar Restaurant, Medan",Adwina Marisa,5,They provide 'padang' - the menu already ready and the other one is ala carte and the menu mostly seafood. I like the padang rather then Ala carte
1963,ChIJs9mrhcoxMTAREPUbQbT53BU,"Miramar Restaurant, Medan",FoodieDirectory,5,BBQ chicken was the bomb. The spiciness and the bbq flavour mixed well together. Special tofu is also a must try. I liked how they served the rice with vegetables inside a banana leaf pack. It‚Äôs a must try venue in Medan.

1966,ChIJeZ9DXsoxMTAR96vCFq0Vu3Q,Wajir Seafood,Jason Ryandi Assana,4,"One of the most crowded seafood place in Medan.

Plenty of street parking.
The seafood is really fresh, they cooked it so well that the seafood is still moist. However the execution was bad as most of the sauces were bland.

The only thing really good is the kepa clam and the salted egg squid.

Price for all these = 380K"
1967,ChIJeZ9DXsoxMTAR96vCFq0Vu3Q,Wajir Seafood,ER Sopian,5,"Wajir seafood had a specific excellent service, they have plenty of waitresses and waiters, so you will not be ignored every menu you wanted, quick action for the food to be serviced quality of food is average nice, other good thing it is also good price being offered, I will choose this restaurant especially for my big family in Medan. Suggestion quality of food to be improved"
1968,ChIJeZ9DXsoxMTAR96vCFq0Vu3Q,Wajir Seafood,Agnes Betania,5,"It's a good place to have supper with your family/friends.
You could call them first to book the table and you will get the table on the 2nd floor with AC without minimum spend (available from 6PM and the will keep the table for you maximum 15 minutes after the booking schedule).

If you go on the spot and after 6PM, it's usually so crowded and they will give you the table on the 1st floor without AC (they can give you the table on the 2nd floor depending on the availability at that time).

Most of the dishes they served could be enjoyed for 2-4 people.
The most unforgettable one is The Tomyam Seafood (dish) and the mixed orange & peach juice (beverage)."
1969,ChIJeZ9DXsoxMTAR96vCFq0Vu3Q,Wajir Seafood,Matt Damon,5,"Extremely delicious food, very kindly staff, a large selection of dishes, good price. Wonderful! The best Restoran in Madan and whole Indonesia!"

Overall good experience, good local food and friendly staff."
1971,ChIJyygHdBouMTAReDqFVw402R8,Lembur Kuring,Tian Yong,5,"Food is nice. The Area is very big too. Their Seafood tastes better than the chicken. Only issue was that the rice was 8k per pax, which was much pricier than usual"
1972,ChIJyygHdBouMTAReDqFVw402R8,Lembur Kuring,Chri Su,5,"Good seefood in Medan. Nice place with open sides. No sticky sweaty atmosphere. Food is good and tasty.

Their chicken satay & fried chicken is the bestt!!

1974,ChIJyygHdBouMTAReDqFVw402R8,Lembur Kuring,Zhr,2,Its not a good idea for having iftar there. We have a problem making the reservation and they didnt put our order on the list. We  wait for almost 15 minutes to get rice after iftar. The service is really bad and chaos. The foods also just so so with that kinda price.
1975,ChIJAQhHDcYxMTAR7isZ4k2aBAo,Jade Restaurant,Brian Holiday,4,"Good setting, outstanding attentive service.  Set menu was outstanding taste with a unique presentation.  Unfortunately hard to have conversation with many kids running through the restaurant yelling. The food also did not come at at a good stagger. Some items in set menu (ie Taro ring) did miss the mark‚Äî but all in all I would Defintely return.  3 pax 2,5 Juta."
1976,ChIJAQhHDcYxMTAR7isZ4k2aBAo,Jade Restaurant,Roland Permana,3,"Love hongkong style steamed fish cod & also the scallop. The ambience is nice and very luxurious. Peking duck is out of stock.

However, it is difficult to make reservation as noone is picking up the phone. We finally can get the phone of one of the staff, Pak Andhika but unfortunately the response is very slow. We made the reservation H-2 but it did not even reserve the seat for us. Hope it can be improved."
1977,ChIJAQhHDcYxMTAR7isZ4k2aBAo,Jade Restaurant,riryn sani,3,"5 star taste, presentation, and ambience
2 star services.

We came on Sunday for a table of 3, early at 11am. Only 1 waiter present and the attitude was quite bad. She did not greet us and even spilled tea while pouring it without any effort to wipe it. So, we needed to ask for tissue and wiped it ourselves.

Another waiter came to take our order after no waiter was around for 5 minutes. We were asking about the menu and the response was  short and a little impolite. We gave up asking and just order what we wanted to.

After we were done eating, the waiter just take the empty plate away without any notification and kind of interrupting us when we were laughing and exchanging our phones over the table.

Overall, the service manner was not up to its reputation. Maybe we came too early and they were not awake yet? It‚Äôs 11 am though.

The food was great! The main course and dimsum portion was generous. The presentation was very pretty, exactly the same with the pictures. I would come back again for the food and lowered my expectation for the services."
1978,ChIJAQhHDcYxMTAR7isZ4k2aBAo,Jade Restaurant,dior garnusa,5,"Amazing food! Everything is taste soooo good!

The downside we need to wait around 50 minutes to get Chinese tea and more that 60 minutes for the food and its only half of our order, another 20 minutes the rest of our order is served at the table.

We also need to chase the waitress so many time to remind our food / drink.
Such a pity since the food is totally awesome but the service is far from ok"

What I don‚Äôt like is the sound system, it was very noisy & uncomfortable when they play a happy birthday songs, don‚Äôt like that though. I recommend udang bakar and nasi liwet :)))"

1983,ChIJrbUpddMxMTARqvOs0vnkpkM,Restoran Koki Sunda,Feliks Sipahutar,3,"Good food, good place, medium price. However, I think Koki Sunda need more improvement in some menus i.e. Nasi Liwet. The taste actually is good enough, but salty. I think the chef may reduce the salt on this menu. Also, this restaurant need to improve it's service. Please don't differ the customers by their appearance. We came here with T-shirt/simple clothes and..I feel like the service processes are too slow for us comparing others. In SERVQUAL concepts i learned in college (Industrial Engineering), the service (especially from the guest/customer sit down on table untill the dishes are ready to consume) is one of many keys for customer satisfaction. Koki Sunda need to improve that field."
1984,ChIJrbUpddMxMTARqvOs0vnkpkM,Restoran Koki Sunda,S T,4,"overall all the food was great but the ayam bakar i received was unacceptably dry and rubbery. thankfully the replacement was much better. the sate maleber was super soft and delicious!! the kangkung belacan was good as well but way too spicy :-( the food came fast apart from the nasi goreng which came around 20 minutes later... also it was hot at the table we were at because it wasn't directly under an AC.

overall it was a good experience and the bill ended up being shockingly cheap/affordable considering the large portions. definitely recommend coming here!"
1985,ChIJidSK89ExMTAR73klpOi8FlM,The Upper Level,Sophia Kho,5,High-quality dishes that are exceptionally delicious & thoughtfully prepared to give a great combination of flavours with a fusion twist. Lovely ambience and very well-suited for special occasions or gatherings. The chef‚Äôs tasting menu is a must-try and thoroughly enjoyed the kombucha selection. Definitely a highlight of our Medan trip and would visit again!
1986,ChIJidSK89ExMTAR73klpOi8FlM,The Upper Level,San Springwoods,4,"For a fine dining place, it's not quite as I expected. Lack of smile and thorough explanations from the serving staff kinda put me off. But I have to understand, this is not a Michelin Star restaurant after all. It's just a a restaurant with 'fine dining' theme to it. You get what you paid for. Other than that, dishes are great and amazing. 10/10 will order again. Even tho it's not quite suited for Medanese taste, but you gotta give the chef points for making bold move to serve dishes not familiar with local taste buds. If I want to nitpick, choices for music are pretty bad, I was expecting nice jazzy tune instead of pop rock."
1987,ChIJidSK89ExMTAR73klpOi8FlM,The Upper Level,Juli JAG,5,"Food cooked close to perfection. Love your steak, the salmon skin is crunchy, the seafood is fresh. Love the entr√©. The unagi is savory and has a hint of smokey smell which i enjoy. Corn soup is totally my taste. The sweetness of the corn, the hint of salt from the crunchy prawn is a deadly fusion that makes me unable to stop myself from finishing the whole bowl.

Ambience is calm and comforting. Suitable for a date, they have private room too for a more private event. Love the simple yet tasteful decoration.

Definitely a must try when u come to Medan.

Make sure to make reservation. You won't be disappointed."
1988,ChIJidSK89ExMTAR73klpOi8FlM,The Upper Level,Bendy Chua,5,"Had the Chef's Tasting Menu and was so mind blown. The fine dining setting was homey yet classy, which I really enjoyed as it didn't feel intimidating.

Chef's tasting menu are in pictures below. The ingredients were all super fresh and of quality. Personally enjoyed the Jagung Bakar Senbei a lot! The corn was sweet, nicely grilled and the spice hits the right spot. I wish they sold a whole bowl of it üòÇ

The soup (Hello, Vitamin) was very flavourful without being overpowering. It tasted like it really has a lot of good ingredients boiled within. And super cosy dish for the temperature in Medan.

For my main dish, I ordered the Tenderloin Wagyu which was cooked perfectly for me.

The dessert was also pretty interesting (Suika). It's grilled watermelon! Eat a little bit of each item together - perfection. I especially like how the lime yoghurt tasted with the strawberry gelato üòç

One more special mention, their homemade kombucha is a MUST ORDER. All flavours were really good but personally enjoy the Wolfberry and Dark Grape, and Peach & Oolong the most.

The staff were also very friendly and attentive. Recommend to make a reservation with them before heading down."
1989,ChIJidSK89ExMTAR73klpOi8FlM,The Upper Level,Thomas Yap,5,"Definitely will come back on special occasion..

The dinning experience feels intimate but not intimidating. You can take your family, date, love ones or even business partner and you won't be dissapointed.
But always remember to reserved first before coming, bcs the seating is limited.

The food is top notch. Couldn't asked for more.
The salmon is my favorite, the sauce is the masterpiece.. best salmon steak i've ever tasted.
Spaghetti is al-dente, the shrimp is cooked to perfection
The wagyu don not my favo because i ordered skirt meat, a lil bit chewier but flavour is amazing.. gonna ordered another cut for next visit
The dessert tasted just right to finished overall meal."

It's really crowded on weekends, specifically on Saturday night and Sundays. So, if you have any plans here for the weekend, I would suggest to reserve the table in advance."

In regards about the food, the presentation is up to the standard, however taste wise is just on the mid level. Price Wise, is on the high end, when we went there are discounts for food on the list of 40%, call and confirm before you go there."

Any sensible person would've asked about the detail of our plan (date, time, number of customers).

But not this person. Literally no care was given.

The answer is just... ""Minimum 2,5 million."" Done.

I expect the old timers of my parents generation will still frequent this place but once they're gone.

With such horrid online presence the business will probably struggle to secure younger customers.

Took my business somewhere else and not expecting to look back in the near future."
2003,ChIJsUmcZI4xMTAR7jELO4_z5KU,Taipan Restaurant,Tin Pin,4,"Halal Chinese restaurant serve authentic Chinese cuisine without pork. Price is above average, but the ambience is good, spacious, responsive waiters and waitresses.

Lots of choice in term of food selection, but a little more salt in their dishes. Seafood and vegetables are fresh."
2004,ChIJsUmcZI4xMTAR7jELO4_z5KU,Taipan Restaurant,Edwar Kartio,4,"One of the best dimsum restaurant in Medan despite not serving any pork in their dimsum. Some of the dishes can be a hit and miss but on average they are pretty good. Would highly recommend the fried chicken skin and the fried Beancurd prawn. Plenty of space with some private rooms on the side. The main room is big and have nice lighting decor perfect for special occasions.

2005,ChIJ3VkPs8sxMTARO-CUXExw20o,Rumah Makan Tabona,Zach. D. Yeager,4,Come here because the food ranger. The curry is great. Beef and organs are very tender. The most amazing part is their coffee actually. It was one of the best coffee I‚Äôve ever tasted. The boss said the coffee beans were grown in lake Toba area. The only thing need to improve is the environment. It‚Äôs very hot eat there. They speak Indonesian and mandarin. English seems not very practical there.
2006,ChIJ3VkPs8sxMTARO-CUXExw20o,Rumah Makan Tabona,Swee Kee Chew,3,"This curry is different from Malaysian, having everything in moderation, from the scent of spices, lemark in coconut milk, and more liquidy than creamy in the soup/sauce; it's akin to Sarawak's Laksa minus the spices flavor. One can have chicken, beef or combination of both in the curry to go with rice or noodle. Beef is rendered soft yet does not fall apart.
The place is packed despite occupying 3 shops. Service is fast and friendly ."
2007,ChIJ3VkPs8sxMTARO-CUXExw20o,Rumah Makan Tabona,Omar Ryhan,5,"Very delicious chicken curry dish. The curry is coconut based. Main ingredients are chicken and potatoes. It was quite balanced and delicious and the portion was generous. I also had a lemonade which was very delicious as well, a bit more sugary than I‚Äôm used to though. The atmosphere and seating was clean and calm. Highly recommend!"
2008,ChIJ3VkPs8sxMTARO-CUXExw20o,Rumah Makan Tabona,Jason Ryandi Assana,5,"Best curry noodz !!

The soup is super thick and tasty. The beef is tender, and the organs is also good.

Definitely a gem and always need to go back to this place whenever in town."

Surely will be coming back if happen to have other chance to Medan.
Very recommended restaurant!"
2012,ChIJS6U6gskxMTARct5fEo3hbbM,Tip Top Restaurant,Eka Lim,4,"I guess they don't really take care the taste for ice creams and foods anymore. The omelette was literally telor dadar, so dry and not enough seasoning. The bread that came with it, was a bit underbaked. The ice creams tasted very average. Luckily they still maintain the cakes. If you love cake jadoel then you will love this place."
2013,ChIJS6U6gskxMTARct5fEo3hbbM,Tip Top Restaurant,Winnie Felicia Gunawan,5,"Legendary restaurant! Tried the ice cream and it tasted like traditional sorbet ice cream instead of the creamy one. It tasted unique tho! The donut was quite surprising cause it was like 4 small balls with peanut inside which taste very yummy and savoury! Horen was great as well. Tarts were a bit too dry for me somehow. But the cake was so yummy, moist, and full of flavour. Definitely worth to try"
2014,ChIJS6U6gskxMTARct5fEo3hbbM,Tip Top Restaurant,Liam VA,5,"4304 reviews today. Tip top restaurant is perhaps the oldest restaurant in Medan Town, it's building is artistic and historical style, built-in the days of the Dutch in Indonesia. There's another historical building just right across the street called Tjong Ah Fie.  I don't read so much about Medan history, but I'm pretty sure this place was a place where people of those olden days came by for food and relaxing leisure time. I just couldn't imagine how and what kind of lifestyle people were living on that past long ago time. It must be fun, clean air, clean environment with lots of trees everywhere that produces more oxygen and convinced that time people were more friendly and caring. Yup, one of those days was the good old days. ‚ù§Ô∏è God bless you all üôè"
2015,ChIJk_WTPC0wMTARKDaBwivWx50,Istana Koki Wedding Venue & Event Space,Alice Calden,5,"oh my God. this is so awesome! the place is so nicely decorated, they have so many facilities. you want to sit on the floor while eating? there you go, they have special area for that. you have kids and they tend to get fuzzy out of boredom bc their parents doing lunch + catch up with their friends / relatives? there you go. they have playground for kids. a spacious one, don't worry. whoa.
you need to plan business lunch with business partners? there you go, VIP room with such professional table, and a wall for projector if you would like.
wow. just wow. my mind blown. this place really covers everything you need when you're out to eat!!!
protocols, sure they got it. you can wash your hands right after you arrived. to get in? no need to touch the door, it's an automatic door like in the malls. I couldn't believe how awesome this place is. really.
and the food? oh heavens, take my money right now! the food that we ordered was variously chosen, it's like randomly choose whatever it is in the menu. and I'm blown one more time because none of the food arrived on our table was disappointing, everything is perfectly delicious!!!!!
I'd definitely recommend this place to eat to anyone I know in medan. definitely a must visit! kudos to the chefs, the staff who patiently received our orders, and the staff who brings our food and places them nicely on the table. I really appreciate that. that's a skill, I must say.
well done, istana koki. please stay in business."
2016,ChIJk_WTPC0wMTARKDaBwivWx50,Istana Koki Wedding Venue & Event Space,Tri Novandhy Silaen,5,"The place is cozy with Balinese style. There are some VIP rooms provided if you need special events held. The menu is various and complete. You can choose from western food and until Indonesia typical traditional food. The price is medium. The parking lot is wide too. Overall, the facility is complete. Very recommended."
2017,ChIJk_WTPC0wMTARKDaBwivWx50,Istana Koki Wedding Venue & Event Space,esti aditya,4,"Cozy and nice place. We can also bring kids, they provide playground.

Drink took more than 30 minute still not our. The rest of food is finished eaten. Staff unable to handle and request for the manager to no avail. Only keep saying sorry. Playing ignorance won't solve the problem

The outdoor is a bit dark but when you come for romantic ambience then it will fit. I remember the taste is good, the price is affordable and the staff serve in good manner too.

Good taste, good ambience and good price."
2022,ChIJizyQ80AwMTARj0TJi5Tu4i8,Nuansa Sky Lounge Restoran,Hocky Riyanto,4,"Simple. Its a restaurant where you can eat steamboat as much as you like with 2hours  (all you can eat) . The steamboat food also standard . They have vegetabel,chicken,cow,shrimp,octopus and etc .They also sell other food like any others restaurant sell. But only steamboat that you can eat as much as you like with the price i think cheap . But i recommended a reservation table first."

2026,ChIJCRiDPCwwMTARQt1DVxXBklk,Sajian Bhinneka,Fadlun Maros,1,"First impression's great. Nice atmosphere, love the little pond and the traditional outlook. Free bananas for everyone. Yet, we were having a family meeting here, approximately 6 people failed to show up and the food's already on the table. Surprisingly, they won't let us bring home the remaining of the food. It was good food for us. We ended up leaving so many leftover food on the table that I felt as guilty as hell."
2027,ChIJCRiDPCwwMTARQt1DVxXBklk,Sajian Bhinneka,Liesbeth Aritonang,4,"Lunch with colleague, nice tradisional-colonial exterior atmosfere, delicious food (all-you-can-eat-bananas), little disappointed with drinks (not presentatif, taste nothing special, wanted ""hot"" water, what we get just ""almost warm""...requested 3x)...overall fine"
2028,ChIJCRiDPCwwMTARQt1DVxXBklk,Sajian Bhinneka,Changsu Siris Woo,5,"The food and the service is over average and the ambience is top notch. I came here for my 1st anniversarry dinner, and both my wife and I weren't disappointed a bit. It was so cozy and with the tone-downed lightings and the natury vibe. The food is actually not greater than the Koki Sundah, but I would recommend this place for special occasions."
2029,ChIJCRiDPCwwMTARQt1DVxXBklk,Sajian Bhinneka,Yolanda Samosir,5,"Haven't been here to eat casual dinner, but I had my graduation party here. They have this nicely decorated indoor room for 40 persons and we had buffet for the dinner. The menu was great, we had Ayam Goreng Bhinneka, Cumi Goreng Tepung, Tahu Mercon, and other nice menus. We got charged Rp108.000,- for each person. Because my family is Bataknese and they like to sing, we put a keyboard in the room so we can dance and sing at the party, and we got charged Rp500.000,-. The service was really great too. Overall, it was a really nice experience to have a party here."
2030,ChIJlZatOjgwMTARq7mi1Yfza6U,O'Flahertys,Katsu,4,"You won't find another cafe like this in Medan. If you're a local and would like to have an atmosphere as if you're in another country , this is the place to go.
It's quite dark and dreary, but that's just one of the charms of this place.

Food is actually nothing special. Carbonara had way too much cream in it , and the portion was fairly small.
The ribs were great though.
The toilet needs a renov.

The major selling point here is the area in general."
2031,ChIJlZatOjgwMTARq7mi1Yfza6U,O'Flahertys,Cynthia Rimba,4,"The first place that served pork ribs in town, taste still good. But a little bit pricey, portion is generous. If u like to chill in romantic dining concept, this can be your choice üòÉ

Old restaurant in Medan.
Must try it.
( non halal )"
2033,ChIJlZatOjgwMTARq7mi1Yfza6U,O'Flahertys,Albert Agus,5,"One of my favourite ribs resto at Medan. The best is still Hurricane - Sydney. The closest is wahaha @  Bali or naughty nuri @ Bali. The portion of ribs is just moderate size. Is the same as the prize. The ambience in here is dark, they made it the situation as in western bar ambience. They serve alot of dutch food like bitterbalen, etc."

The food served is also delicious food served: beef ribs, and there are also pork, there are also beef steaks and others, but it's not just meat but there is also fried rice and other. The cost is very expensive, for indonesia.jika in treats a lot of messages because it is very tasty but I eat 2 course is full because it is very much eat but tasty. the place is a bit far from the city but delicious thank you for reading please in like ..."
2035,ChIJD5thHMoxMTARGOXD_1kDLew,Garuda Restaurant,Mohammed Fadi Qaddo,4,"Very nice idea where they bring the whole menu to your table as dishes and you pay for what u choose to eat.

Prices are quite expensive compared to same dishes served in next door restaurants.

The restaurant is hot due to no AC installed and the spices of the dishes make it more.

The staff is friendly and gesturing BUT no language is spoken here except Indonesian (must improve their English to communicate better with foreign customers).

Overall it os a good experience."
2036,ChIJD5thHMoxMTARGOXD_1kDLew,Garuda Restaurant,Jeffri Amsar,5,"Taste was great, I tried the white snapper gulai, gulai sayur daun singkong tumbuk, and ayam goreng kremes. The caramel pudding also nice. However car parking could be an issue at the busy hours"

2038,ChIJD5thHMoxMTARGOXD_1kDLew,Garuda Restaurant,Hew Choon Kok,3,"We a group of 9 pax, having around 10 dishes, cost us R100k+ per person, very expensive. This the first time having nasi Padang, quite variety of Indonesian local food, most of than are very good to us, only 2 not ours cup."
2039,ChIJD5thHMoxMTARGOXD_1kDLew,Garuda Restaurant,David Rowley,3,"It was nice food but far too expensive for what they offer. Better try another Nasi Padang. Paid 340,000 for two people."
2040,ChIJibVIY8wxMTARK4gjashjelo,District 10 Restaurant & Bar,Konrad Lentschig,5,"It's a very modern architecture and cozy restaurant with lots of different food. You will find European dishes as well as traditional local meals.

I had a very nice conversation with the manager. She speaks English and we shared a few information about myself and Medan. The stuff is also very polite and open minded.

As a German I was happy to get Erdinger Wei√übier. They offer  Paulaner Bier too.  After my spaghetti carbonara I had a shot of good Irish whiskey. That is what I call: Ars vivendi!

Thanks for an amazing night in Medan."
2041,ChIJibVIY8wxMTARK4gjashjelo,District 10 Restaurant & Bar,Paul,4,"One of the best (and only) truly Western-style bars in Medan.  Relaxed ambiance suitable for decompressing after a day at the office or in meetings.  Indoor and outdoor seating as well as bar seating if you're traveling solo.  Live music on the weekend evenings. Bartender Harry is a good guy who speaks some English.

Decent selection of liquor - but remember that hard liquor is less common in Indonesia and Medan.  Jack Daniels and Jose Cuervo are considered top shelf here, but this bar also boasts a few Indonesian whiskeys to try.  Long Islands are solid and they add a nice twist on whiskey sours with a cinnamon stir-stick/garnish.

Food is good and it's one of the better places for pizza in town.  Fried squid and fried chicken skins are also delicious.  Prices are reasonable, they also take credit cards.

Ironically, it's literally right next door to another nice and relaxing bar/restaurant, Harbor 9."
2042,ChIJibVIY8wxMTARK4gjashjelo,District 10 Restaurant & Bar,son Ia,3,"The environment is good, the cocktails taste good and we cant even feel the alcohol.
For the food, i really don‚Äôt recommend u guys to order the creamy mushroom soup. Its bad, and not creamy at all. The pizza is just ok, we got a discount."
2043,ChIJibVIY8wxMTARK4gjashjelo,District 10 Restaurant & Bar,Qi Sun,4,"Food feels fresh, well cooked and met expectations. Place didn't have much to see, nor look well maintained. Service isn't bad however definitely not top quality. The reason for lower service score is due to some bad experience during my visit"
2044,ChIJibVIY8wxMTARK4gjashjelo,District 10 Restaurant & Bar,Wilsen Lius,5,"Good selection of wine and whiskey. After renovation, its audio is top notched! You will be blown away by its quality Audio. Good bands and House DJ."
2045,ChIJDdtNms0xMTARI7HKP9Yr-MA,Nelayan Jala Jala Sun Plaza,Edmund KW,5,"One of the best dim sum experiences I've had. Many good dim sum restaurants have evolved into expensive fine dining pseudo-palaces or more economical options that only serve a few dim sum classics; Nelayan retains the heart and spirit of dim sum offering a very wide variety of classic and cleverly adjusted tasty halal dishes. You can order from a menu, but there are also wandering waitresses bearing trays of tempting dim sum to entice you to try more of their dishes. The atmosphere is great - with all the buzz and bustle of a traditional popular dim sum restaurant. The service is good despite the crowds and the prices are very reasonable."
2046,ChIJDdtNms0xMTARI7HKP9Yr-MA,Nelayan Jala Jala Sun Plaza,Respati Tamio,5,"Great varieties of dim sum, with affordable prices. Taste is very good. Yummy. Also, this place might be very good for you for a rookie on dimsum. everythings were good and delish"

2048,ChIJDdtNms0xMTARI7HKP9Yr-MA,Nelayan Jala Jala Sun Plaza,Norman Berthiaume,5,"This place is a classic Asian street food market.  This location goes back generations.  If your looking for a taste from the past, then this is it
Only food is sold here. All classic Medan type food and desserts. Well needless  to say area is dirty.  Everyone drops things on the street but tables are clean and there are toilets available for your needs.  Food is always hot, fresh and prepared before your eyes. All the  things I ate was fresh and served hot.  Portions are fair for the prices."
2049,ChIJDdtNms0xMTARI7HKP9Yr-MA,Nelayan Jala Jala Sun Plaza,Yanimi Khoe,2,"The taste was not like the old time.
It is also pricy.
The vibe is also not comfortable for hangout for a bit longer.
I came here only for the memory for a plate of leng hong kien which is lower than I would expect.

The 'lumpia kulit tahu' also very oily and less prawn inside.

The porridge also plain. Nothing special. Cakue is again very oily.

Many dimsum restaurants which offer more delicious and friendly price and vibe."

Moreover, it's also beautifully designed to fulfill your passion in taking photographs. The are many picturesque decorations which can be good backgrounds for you. Instead of being picturesque, this place has a bit slow service. Sometimes it takes more than 30 minutes to serve a group of 10. The waiter and waitress are kind and helpful.

Beyond my imagination‚Ä¶..

Main course-beef steak is overcooked and as hard as a rock.
I never taste the steak is hard like that‚Ä¶.
And the stuff didn‚Äôt asked us how to cook the beef.

Dessert-br√ªl√©e with strawberry sauce.

2071,ChIJMxj5cTYwMTARCsQAHovw7Xg,Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,Anthony Ricardo,2,"Suitable as a family restaurant if you don't mind the terrible service.

Services are slow, so-so, and bill was inaccurate (extra drinks from heavens know where). The food are nothing to write home about. It's tasty and fresh but unless Thai food tastes the same as Indonesian, then this restaurant is about as authentic as local recipe.

One bizarre experience is the complimentary dessert that was limited to one dish per table. Imagine splitting two small plates to 14 people. Such a cheap experience in a restaurant with 50K upward dishes."

All the food is pretty average and the only stand outs for us are the prawn curry and the complimentary desserts.

I actually love the food here very much because they use fresh ingredients such as fish sourced directly from Gabion port and etc.

For S$180, you get a big pot of deer bone soup with vermicelli for 10 pax. The aroma of the soup fills your nostril the minute it is served.

The bamboo clamps cooked with either garlic sauce,  or mayonnaise sauce are tasty."

The regular/medium is suitable to 6-8 people
The large is suitable for up to 10 people.
If you are in a group of 6 like me and plan to order several dishes, small size is pretty enough.
You can call the restaurant to book a table before you dine in to make sure that the restaurant is opened as there is certain time when they are having a break.

The restaurant was quite old as the interior is not updated nor visually aesthetic as an old restaurant. The service is good, could be better with training.

Small things that bothers the eating experience is about the condiments at the table, which is the chopped garlic is not covered with a lid, which makes the smell puts off the good eating experience.

There are only 1 urinal and 1 sink at the toilet."

The food here is quite well done, quality is on par with western restaurants twice its price in other countries. However, for Medan pricing standards, this likely is considered as expensive.  This is not really a fault as were still many patrons while I was there.  Other than that, staff were friendly and service was great. Would recommend if you have a hankering for western dishes like chicken parmigiana."
2141,ChIJDSZlZs4xMTARNyGxQIrNK_E,The Big Eyed,Juliany Chandra,4,"Trying their crispy potato skin (IDR41k) and chicken quesadillas (IDR60k), both are over seasoning in my opinion. Potato skin is too sour and sweet (using thai sauce) and the quesadillas quite spicy but still the waiter give me chili sauce not long after serving. There is additional tax 10% and service tax 6% if you eat here."
2142,ChIJDSZlZs4xMTARNyGxQIrNK_E,The Big Eyed,Wynne Min,5,"Perfect for brunch and very instagrammable, why? The glass windows are very wide so this restaurant get a lot of natural sunlight, plating is also very nice.

But the best thing is : their food is really delicious. Their egg benedict, mushroom on toast and porchick are my favourites. Their olive fried rice is also nice. I wonder how can they make something with really basic ingredients into something that is so simply delicious.

Ah, I also love the flowers they put on the tables. Nice touch

Sadly price point a little bit higher than your usual brunch."

Another upset is the proyector also cannot be used, we sit at corner side cannot see anything except the building wall.

2166,ChIJd87vkccxMTARKHhqGU8EjEQ,Healy Macs Bar And Restaurant Medan,sivabalan nadarajan,1,The service and food is really really bad. The waitresses just sitting at the bar area and really difficult to get their attention. The live band is horrible and just singing Chinese songs the entire time. They didn‚Äôt have a courtesy to let us know that they can‚Äôt sing the songs we requested. It‚Äôs really an awful experience for a so called Irish pub. If you are an international traveler‚Ä¶..this is a wrong place to go.

From the mildly revamped interior, unique furniture, warm services, and the presentation of the food. We didn't have any complaint on the food, they tasted great!

2187,ChIJPak-byAxMTAR4Y3WovQcDDE,Lebanon Restaurant,Paul,5,"The best Middle Eastern food in Medan!  Service is prompt and servers are courteous.  Located on the ground floor of Cambridge Mall so you have the bonus of people watching.

Hummus is very authentic and their tabouli is good although it doesn't include bulgar wheat - could be a regional variation or a family recipe.  Still delicious.  Their mixed-family grill is a good option for sharing between either two people or the whole family (note the price difference!), providing beef, chicken and lamb.  I recommend a side order of naan (garlic naan is delicious) to completely enjoy the hummus and tabouli!

Prices may seem high but the menu is very meat-intensive and the flavors are both delicious and authentic.  They also offer local-style favorites as well as Western options like pizza.  If you're craving something different, this is a must-eat place (assuming you like Middle Eastern food!)."
2188,ChIJPak-byAxMTAR4Y3WovQcDDE,Lebanon Restaurant,Tom Alex Koster,4,"Taste was very good, price a little bit high. But if price is not a problem this is the right place for tasty and good food.
Falafel is good but definitely to small, chef you need to make them bigger, that's a shame, it's a Lebanese restaurant and not a kinder garden.
But all was very clean and tasty. See at the pictures"
2189,ChIJPak-byAxMTAR4Y3WovQcDDE,Lebanon Restaurant,San Springwoods,4,"somewhat a false advertising on their part. was expecting lebanese food, but was served persian and  indian food instead. Overly priced for an OK food. I suppose the money went to exceptional staff training. All the staff there are so friendly they can be your BFF the moment you step into the place. Staff and service are a definite 10. The food tho, not so much."

You can adjust the level of spiciness.
The price start around IDR 20k.

Good interior and very clean place, their food also good, we order lamb curry and Arab rice.
Dont forget to order their Arab tea.
Taste is good, meat is tender, rice is great."
2196,ChIJq6qqqtUvMTAR1UbjRddsMYM,Al Jazeerah Restaurant & Cafe Medan,Veronica Phing,5,"Hands down the best lamb briyani i've ever tried in Medan. The spices of briyani rice was kind of mild which made our eating experience very pleasant. The LAMB omg so tender that it falls apart from the bone, and when you bite into it, it melts. Most importantly, zero typical lamb-ish smell. Super recommended! Meanwhile, the chicken was not good, the flesh was kinda tough with minimal flavor. Just opt for the lamb pls! It'd be perfect if they gave more lamb haha.

On a side note, the appetizer (chicken wrap) was very very good. We kinda did not expect it to be good hahaha. Another must order item too! The arabic tea was also nice with a hint of mint.

The staffs were very helpful to explain and recommend the menus for us. The pricepoint was kind of decent considering the quality of food. I don't think it's overpriced, for sure. The downside of the resto was the AC was not working properly so it was slightly warm there.

Overall, nice experience and now i know where to find good lamb briyani."

2205,ChIJow416cMxMTARsO8WwFO6-0E,Prime Steakhouse,Ming T. Chow,3,"Steakhouse in Medan's JW Marriot hotel.  Nicely decorated with live band gives the place a classy atmosphere. For Medan prices, this is priced very high but for international standards it is priced around a mid or mid-high end steakhouse.  Had the mushroom soup and lobster bisque as appetizers and while they were good, they were nothing special. I suspect the lobster bisque to be from a can with some fresh lobster bits thrown in.  The steak itself was quite decent and cooked to the requested temperature. The sauces were flavourful too.  However, the accompanying vegetables (diced peas, carrots) just made the whole dish look cheaper since they look like they broke open a pack of frozen vegetables. Unsure why this decision was made. Overall, the dinner was enjoyable but I expected more unique tastes and presentation from a restaurant of this price range in any country. Worth a try while in Medan but nothing too special if you are used to steakhouses elsewhere."
2206,ChIJow416cMxMTARsO8WwFO6-0E,Prime Steakhouse,Avocado Queen,4,How can you not have a piece of good steak when you are in Medan? In PRIME we trust for a good steak. Was there in Medan with Natalie for hiking and we stayed at JW Marriott Hotel for 5 nights. Prime is accessible from the Lobby of the hotel. The steak was good and service was excellent. ü§óü§ó
2207,ChIJow416cMxMTARsO8WwFO6-0E,Prime Steakhouse,Fly High,1,"Had dinner there a few days back:
-The stakes are frozen and not much good quality,
-The chef cooked our filet mignon bloody rare where we asked him for a medium rare. When returned back, they cooked again and brought it as dry as a bone...
-There is such a bad smell to the place, and poor ventilation
-The place is empty
-located in a basement
The air-conditioning is so direct on the tables
-They apologised and brought us ice cream
-value for money is Zero
I would not recommend this place. The reason we went to it is cause we have been in the area for 2 weeks and looking for a good meal. Unfortunately, the rating of this restaurant does not reflect its true value"
2208,ChIJow416cMxMTARsO8WwFO6-0E,Prime Steakhouse,Food & Travel Explorer,4,"We had our wedding anniversary dinner in Prime Steak house. During reservation, they offer us to decorate our table for free. Eventough the decoration is very simple, but it makes our table so special. We really enjoyed the live band performance and we heard a lot of romantic song that night. The steak is very good especially the red wine sauce. Even tough the price is quite expensive, we really enjoyed our wedding anniversary dinner that night."

Under tight supervision from its management, this restaurant has managed to maintain its standard service and food taste. Frankly speaking, I could still taste its delicacy and feel the cleanliness and comfort of the restaurant when having dinner at this place a week ago. It also provides visitors the smoking room and non-smoking room. Not to mention artistic gazebos in the back yard of the restaurant which are surrounded by beautiful flowers, making it so attractive and exotic. I recommend this restaurant for those who want to experience Padang food sensation."
2211,ChIJOyktESouMTARpRYtKV7yxzM,Restoran Garuda medan,Wan Asrul,3,"I would say that the food here is just average. You could have a whole spread of padang dishes from this restaurant but nothing taste extremely good or caught my taste bud. The price for the food is quite steep as well (as compared to other places that I have been to in Medan). Nevertheless, they provide a really good customer services and ambiance. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Hats off to the management for being able to train all of their staff really well. You could also choose from one of the three type seating offered: air condition/garden view/fan seating. Perhaps, they'll charge differently based on the choice of your seating.  All in all, if you would like to enjoy a quite decent padang food with a good ambiance, here could be the right place for you."

Gave us almost worn out menu and then gave some suggestion while we order the food. Not all the menu are available during our visit. Tried to order some beef lasagna but they only have pork instead which was not in the menu book but at the promo table stand.
Quite disappointed when my margerita pizza came out without basil leaves on it. None the less, it was good pizza.
The lasagna was quite dry at the bottom, my guess it was not made daily. My kid said it tasted better then pizza h*t's lasagna which we had couple days ago.
The calzone was a bit undercooked, my wife just had a couple bites of it and that's it.
Take away bag, here we go....

For drinks they only have tea and beers, moctails was not available during our visit.
But we can order drinks from other tenants in the building.

The only thing is this restaurant is quite pricey and they will keep offering you foods to your table (sales strategy) so it will increase your desire to buy more when you see the food"

As for the seafood platter with sauce of your choice, selected the Padang sauce. I am not a fan of sweet sauce.

The indoor and outdoor seating are clean. Open kitchen, clean cooking area. Service is alright."

2265,ChIJXXwJSykwMTARxWcp1fT4Bbc,The Traders Restaurant,rizky hermawan,4,"A fancy restaurant with lovely choice of menu. This is a western style restaurant. So the meals and beverages are served in western style or Indonesian fusion. They have several rooms that can be set up in private or meeting room. Because the market are middle to upper class than yes it's kinda pricey.
Services are ok, fast and responsive, atmosphere a bit classic but comfy."
2266,ChIJXXwJSykwMTARxWcp1fT4Bbc,The Traders Restaurant,Anggi Ariella,4,"the food was okay. the starter (scallop salad) arrived after the steak üòÖ we ordered 2 US prime with promotion (BOGO) & spaghetti carbonara. the wine is good. they only sell local brand wine for glasses, and we ended up ordered wine by bottle which the waitress give us 10% discount, thanks for that. the dessert is great, choco lava cake and tiramisu ‚ú® when we arrived, they have complimentary salad & soup buffet which was okay. but the service of the staff could be better. they chat and goofing around, we need to call them and raise hands several times, but still not paying attention to the guests. kinda dissapointed. but overall, we had a great time there."
2267,ChIJXXwJSykwMTARxWcp1fT4Bbc,The Traders Restaurant,Paul,3,"This is a very pleasant place for a meal, and the prices clearly reflect that management feels the same about it.  Unfortunately, while the atmosphere and service are both top-notch, the food and drinks are less noteworthy.  Not bad, just not at the exceptional level the pricing might indicate.  Service is very polite and attentive though English may be lacking.  You can pay by either cash or credit card.

The Traders offers a set of Western menu options in addition to traditional Indonesian selections.  The food is in no way bad but it isn't noteworthy.  I was particularly disappointed to find the sambal they serve is a store-bought sauce, essentially slightly spicy ketchup.  For the prices and ambiance a place like this certainly ought to have their own in-house sambal recipe(s)!  Little things like this lead me to assert the food is not worth the prices charged.

They also have a bar and a somewhat impressive collection of Scotch whisky.  Their cocktails are serviceable but also not noteworthy.  Whiskey sour is fine as is the gin and tonic.  As is typical throughout Southeast Asia tequila options are very slim, limited primarily to varieties of Patron and Jose Cuervo.  At nearly $10 per drink I felt the whiskey sours were a little small, but the taste was good and they were deliciously cold and refreshing on a hot Medan day.

They also have a wine selection and a good selection of imported craft beers that can be ordered to-go.  Pricey, but if you're craving a small-batch craft beer it's worth checking out.

Again, this is a very nice place to sit and chat either personally or for business and staff are wonderful.  Booths are available towards the rear of the restaurant and tables and chairs are the norm in the forward 2/3 of the restaurant.  Everything presents a very top-tier establishment.  If ambiance is what you need, this is an excellent place to go."

We can also choose dining in an indoor aircond room or outdoor non air-cond either, with the same enjoyment in a little different comfort. (080822-190822)"

However, their tofu and soup was pretty good.  I especially loved the tofu, which was served with scallions, mushrooms, fish stomach and a great sauce. The soup was ginseng with chicken herbs and mushrooms and delicious even though I could really taste the ginseng.  The duck was ok - crispy and tender but a trifle dry and the sauce was starchy. The service was very good and the prices were very reasonable."

So everytime i visit Medan I will eat at Sushi Tei and never miss it. SERIOUSLY MUST VISIT. best japanese vegetarian cuisine. The price may seems bit expensice but if you see the quality ingredient, the portion, the taste, the service, the free flow of japanese ocha-hot or ice, the ambiance, then it all just cheap (cheaper the Nelayan in my opinion).

A good selection of grilled and fried fish. Their seafood nachos are a little oily from liberal use of cheese and butter but also sport some of the only guacamole I‚Äôve seen in Medan. Grilled calamari is delicious in a butter sauce that makes the spicy mayo dip unnecessary. Their mussels appetizer is all right but there‚Äôs a hint of sweetness that put me off, and the bread - while a nice and rare touch in Medan! - also had a slightly sweet flavor. Their French fries are a solid hit - firm, piping hot and deliciously seasoned.

Their passion fruit tea was deliciously sweet to counteract the saltiness of the food. It‚Äôs served in a carafe and is a generous amount for two people to share.

I‚Äôd definitely eat here again as a change of pace.  The price is a little high but portions are generous."

I think this one is okay since the other one in the town seemly closed.  But, I still have to say that as long as it is hala accredited, it shall not be the same as.thr truly authentic Korean cuisine, since the most important ingredient has been taken away and forbidden.  I can understand that but certainly this has been localizsed for sure.  In this case, I  still come to this store just to eat something that is hot enough for me.  I mean the temperature of serving food but not how spicy the dishes are.  I really enjoy the ginseng chicken soup at least this one really taste like Korean.  For the rest, the seafood pancake is definitely a disaster, especially for the sauce they provided especially added the only can find Indonesia demon chili, the green one.  That is terrible.  Other foods are all too sweet like they never need to pay for sugar.   For staying in Indonesia, I really hate the two things, one is the chili and one is the sweet.  Plesse, do some human research for preventing Diabetes or the stomach intestine problem that cause definitely by the chili you consume.  It is really not healthy at all."

The fried chicken is good! Juicy inside and crispy outside, the kangkung belacan is not so spicy and served with thicker sauce, but i am abit disappointed with the fried rice as i cannot really taste the salted fish flavor, it just like standard chinese fried rice.

Their pork bistik is good and taste like how it should be.

2334,ChIJa9V65GnmaC4RK2VkdPV8lKM,Gormeteria,Novi Faldian,5,"Nice place for hangout, the coffee is good, dish amazing with premium quality and premium price. Fast and friendly service. Limited parking lot, but we can use valet parking for 20k rupiah."
2335,ChIJd5G4NvPmaC4RBd-NWFwpSRg,La Costilla (Affordable Casual Dining),Arvin Tanu,4,"Food: loves the ribs. Probably the best in Bandung. Anything else is alright. The jambalaya was too dry, the escargot was too chewy, and the potato gratin was tasteless. But general, the food was great for its fair price.

Ambience: loves it. Very blue.

Conclusion: you dont have to go far to Bali to taste good ribs no more. Just come to this resto."
2336,ChIJd5G4NvPmaC4RBd-NWFwpSRg,La Costilla (Affordable Casual Dining),Wilson Teja,5,"The food is good and worth to price. Order onion ring, ribs, escargot and pork belly with thai sauce. Their ribs is tasty even we only order local ribs.  Escargot and pork belly also good.
They only provide small parking space but you can park on the street.
Service is also good."
2337,ChIJd5G4NvPmaC4RBd-NWFwpSRg,La Costilla (Affordable Casual Dining),Ronald Candiago,5,"Black angus 5 star, no doubt. Tender, juicy, mushroom sauce not just cream but also tasty.
Cod fish also 5 star, spicy sauce blend with creamy taste.
Ribs just 3 star. The smokey taste very nice, but it almost no meat at ribs.
Pizza also nice, but the base sauce i think too much, so it very sweet after 2 slice.
Overall 4,5.  i want try another food here."
2338,ChIJd5G4NvPmaC4RBd-NWFwpSRg,La Costilla (Affordable Casual Dining),Hannah Truitt,5,"Delicious! We got the burnt lemon chicken, the teriyaki salmon, and the potato soup.

The chicken was probably our favorite - the mashed sweet potatoes were amazing.

The potato soup was INCREDIBLE, my only complaint is that I wish they had an option for a bigger portion of it - the bowl was very small."
2339,ChIJd5G4NvPmaC4RBd-NWFwpSRg,La Costilla (Affordable Casual Dining),Teddy Hatadjie,4,"Taste : Just OK, the baby back ribs is quite good but very lack of side dish ( no salad / dressing ) & poor plating food presentation, the Curry from Japanese curry Rice was saving the day.

Price : Medium, overprice for the ribs

Menu : Less Variety but tempting

Ambience : Cozy, great for hangout, indoor only

Location : A bit hard to find ( because the sign is small ), in the main street of Dr. Sutami

Parking Space : Large

Service : Quick, Friendly, Knowledgeable

Revisit : Maybe"
2340,ChIJlesM_RXmaC4R54fStJCsL58,Fresco Bandung,joko muslim,5,"First time here, quite a surprise finding they are actually in Hilton hotel floor 6.
Not really like what came out of our mine.
It‚Äôs kind of fine dining of Italian resto.
We were served with complimentary snacks such as bread and stick with pesto. This was an interesting start.
Then came the super friendly and handy manager, Mr. Yusup.
He is really the frontline of this resto that establish the wonderful welcome impression. He explained enthousiastic the menu.
We ordered 2 pans of pizza, a bowl of risotto and drinks.
We order too much this time and at the end we asked to wrapped up for take a way.
They tasted a lot similar as what we had in Italy, surely with some adjustments. They are great.
The ambience was good. The price was reasonable as cuisines serve in star hotel.
We will absolutely come back for another taste of Italian cuisine next time.

I would suggest to serve bottle of free tap water as they do in Italy. ü§≠ü§≠
Special thanks to mr. Yusup for your great hospitality and those chit chat, Mr. Guntur for drinks and chef Vira for all the pizzas and risotto.
Wish the best for you all."
2341,ChIJlesM_RXmaC4R54fStJCsL58,Fresco Bandung,Prajnawati Wibowo,1,"The worst rib I‚Äôve ever eaten in my life. For USD $125.00 (2 juta rupiah), I would have expected something edible instead of tough, tasteless and unappetizing meat.  One bite and I am having a hard time swallowing. The seafood is so so. The beef carpaccio is so-so. It certainly doesn‚Äôt live up to Hilton hotel. The service is very slow as well. I am very disappointed. The worst USD $225 I‚Äôve spent."
2342,ChIJlesM_RXmaC4R54fStJCsL58,Fresco Bandung,Hendy Tjhai,5,"So far, this is the best italian restaurant in Bandung. All the foods have authentic taste of Italy. I, myself love the Quattro Formagio Pizza, Salmone Alla Griglia (Salmon Steak) and Grilled Tuscany Beef.
Great job guys, thanks for your hospitality and we have a chance to meet with the Chef, Mr. Angga. üëçüôè"
2343,ChIJlesM_RXmaC4R54fStJCsL58,Fresco Bandung,Marcella Cindy,5,"I had dinner here to celebrate my birthday. Foods are great, price is still reasonable, and ambience is superb. I felt like having the restaurant for my own since there were no one except us at that time.

The service was incredible, and the waiter Pak Tarjo is very friendly and helpful. Other team including Pak Panca, Chef Gegep, Chef Apuy, Chef Guruh also very nice to us.

What is very surprising for me, they come to our table and singing happy birthday song, and one of them also brought a musical instrument to accompany their singing. Big thanks for them to make my birthday night memorable."
2344,ChIJlesM_RXmaC4R54fStJCsL58,Fresco Bandung,Haitham Ahmed,5,"The seafood is great, thanks Yusup for the service and chef Angga for the delicious food. The atmosphere is great, in front of the swimming pool."

üç∞ Green Tea Layer Cake (10/10), Rp.35.000

üç¥ F&B: Well, I‚Äôll start from the Green Tea Layer Cake. It‚Äôs super recommended!!! Super tasty omg, the green tea taste so balance because it‚Äôs not too bitter and not too sweet. For Spaghetti Green Pesto to be honest has a good taste but.. The platting is sooooo bad! They don‚Äôt put the pasta nicely and there is no edible flower. I mean, this spaghetti only has a few mushrooms, at least if the edible flower existed then the customer will not look at this food as a boring one. About the Chicken Melt, it‚Äôs super standard for that price.. BUT, the mushroom sauce is SOOOOO GOOOOODDD!!! (5/10) is for the chicken, but for the mushroom sauce I‚Äôll give (10/10)! Iced Strawberry Tea just standard, nothing special. And they gave us a cup pf cendol as a free takjil but it tastes really awful :(. Overall (7/10) for the F&Bs."
2347,ChIJR5gv3UjmaC4RwnivXflmOg4,MASA,Ayunda Sheya,5,"great place and great food!! I love the ambiance of the place. a great view of the backyard with greeneries, love it! the food is also great! they have steaks, pasta, pizza, and a wide range of Indonesian food. They also serve wide range of alcohol from beer, wine, even korean soju. There are also live musics at night."
2348,ChIJR5gv3UjmaC4RwnivXflmOg4,MASA,Pundi Sakti Bagus Wasono,5,"Delicious food. the light is too dim. When our food is finished, the waiter immediately takes our plates. Steak (meat and sauce) is too salty."

The food is great as well, and clean!
Sadly there isn't much plug if you wanted to charge, for example the tables nearby the pond doesn't have any plug so if you wanted to charge your devices it might be hard, or you can ask to charge at the cashier.
Since the place is quite open, there isn't any bell on the table, so when there isn't any waiters around it might take a while for them to take your orders.

Overall, it was a great experience!"
2353,ChIJ6xjQYILoaC4R0dKCUDv_bhw,Atmosphere Resort Caf√©,Christian Hardy,5,"Expensive, decent portion, and tastes good. Last time I tried ""Pepper Steak"" and ""Fish Cordon Bleu"", both tastes good. Services was really satisfying. The place was huge, clean, and very comfortable. Backyard area was very good place to eat if you bring your children. Recommended place to eat with your big family or co-workers.

2355,ChIJIbRneujmaC4RRAGka69dSLM,Miss Bee Providore,Ahmad Randy,4,"Beautiful, cozy, and well-designed restaurant. Various western, Italian, and Indonesian-inspired food. The Indonesian food was a modernized version, not 100% authentic. But still, they were delicious.

Every seating has its own unique view, friendly staff, and clean area. There was also a nice small children playground."
2356,ChIJIbRneujmaC4RRAGka69dSLM,Miss Bee Providore,Monica Febriana,4,"This restaurant had a nice ambiance and a spacious area. This restaurant has two areas indoor and outdoor. Also it has a kid‚Äôs area to play. A good place to work, hangout, or meet with partner.
They offer various menus from Indonesia, western, and Italian. I ordered cheese fries, portobello fries, mushroom carbonara, and fish and chips. The pasta is nothing special but the fish and chips are more delicious than the famous restaurant in the mall.
The bathroom is clean. Their staff is nice and helpful. The best tine to come to this restaurant is at brunch time or at the afternoon before dinner time."
2357,ChIJIbRneujmaC4RRAGka69dSLM,Miss Bee Providore,Iyan Iyan,5,"The ambience is nice, lots of greenery and fresh air due to slightly high altitude in the city. We ordered several foods and all are delicious. Taco's and salad are fresh and good. I also recommend their fresh juice."
2358,ChIJIbRneujmaC4RRAGka69dSLM,Miss Bee Providore,Jessica Elfrida,5,"Food : 5/5
Great taste in every menu i chose. Caesar salad was crisp and fresh, chicken was also good. The roasted rosemary chicken was one of the best that i have ever eaten, good one. Fried chicken bolognese was also very nice, chicken was nicely done, the bolognese sauce was very tasty. The wrap with chicken and avocado was also nicely done. All were good, washed down with nice cold beer or pandan ice tea."
2359,ChIJIbRneujmaC4RRAGka69dSLM,Miss Bee Providore,Jeffry William,5,"I think this must be at least my fifth time here. Absolutely love this place. My 3 year old son loved the outdoor playground area, the swing, the rabbit area, and the seesaw. The food is also very good. Salmon rosti is my personal favourite. Salmon mentai rice is excellent. Iced thai tea is special and definitely worth a try. Only downside is the place is not fully sheltered. So if it rains, some seating places outdoor is not suitable"
2360,ChIJY23nzVfmaC4RiJ_kfU7wHjI,Kapulaga Indonesian Bistro,Raflyoxa Ekalufta,5,A nice sundanese restaurant with various interesting menu. This place have an outdoor park. It's available for wedding venue.

2363,ChIJY23nzVfmaC4RiJ_kfU7wHjI,Kapulaga Indonesian Bistro,O Setiawan,5,"Great food. I love almost every dish they serve in the restaurant. Definitely no complains at all.

They have a quite spacious restaurant and garden, they also have slides which will be very great for you to bring your kids. This restaurant also have high chairs for your kids available. I highly recommended this place for both leisure and business meeting.

Another thing I love about the restaurant is how friendly and fast their service is."
2364,ChIJY23nzVfmaC4RiJ_kfU7wHjI,Kapulaga Indonesian Bistro,Ruri Fitriyanti,3,"According to my opinion, the food is so ordinary. Indonesian food is not only Sundanese food. So, I think they should improve the variant and taste of the food. I can say the price is affordable, except for the rice. For a portion of rice, you have to pay IDR 9k. I got a little bit disappointed with their presentation of food since they weren't look the same like in the pics.

The place is huge. There are indoor and outdoor areas. Suitable for groups of family, friends, or colleagues. There is a quite large garden and I have to admit the ambience is good. It is cozy and instagrammable as well. The staff are friendly.

Kapulaga is under the same group as Bee Hive and its boutique hotel. It is connected to the hotel."
2365,ChIJoQgWQ3rnaC4REmtAU_kfHkg,Sadrasa Kitchen & Bar,Linda Gunawan,5,"Went for breakfast while staying at the hotel. That time the place was packed with guests mainly from the same group attending a seminar held at the hotel. Was helped by Miss Sinta and she managed to find a table for us. Given by the mass of people cramping the place at one time overall service was OK and I assume service would be impeccable if there were less crowd. Ordering coffee was too long to arrive, dirty plates were piling up and took sometime to be cleared. Food was okay, variations and quality are acceptable yet slightly below other 5 stars hotel."
2366,ChIJoQgWQ3rnaC4REmtAU_kfHkg,Sadrasa Kitchen & Bar,Rakhma Leana,5,"A pleasureable experience to complement the stay. Accompanied by Alam and Dari, they assist us to make sure we have the best dining experience for our breakfast. The restaurant provides an international breakfast setting which makes it easier for the guests to choose their preferred menu. The taste in overall also nice. But one of the best part is the restaurant ambience. The timeless interior setting combined with a modern touch in the material finishing paired with a soft music as the background. A pleasurable experience, indeed."
2367,ChIJoQgWQ3rnaC4REmtAU_kfHkg,Sadrasa Kitchen & Bar,Cintya Ida Ayu,5,Portion is large. Kids meal is like adult size. Commensurate with the high price. Various types of Indonesian and Western food. Service was quiet fast. Monday evening the place is pretty empty.

2370,ChIJ2dX2tM3naC4RG6Gcgz_vyWU,Bawean Resto,Gifford Chaziel,5,"When i read the menu, i was like ""omg they're pricey"" but since it was our anniversary so it's okay.
When the food served, yep, they were so delicious.
We ordered sour ribs soup, australian tenderloin, bento, salmon, a pot of lemon tea and home made ice cream.
We were satisfied with all of them.
The ribs were tender, juicy and unexpectedly HUGE (a bowl consisted of three big meaty ribs) served with rice, some crackers and a slice of lime (plus chili sambal). It tasted sour and spicy. They put some herbs in it (clover and a bit nutmeg i thought).
The tenderloin steak was a bit small but tender. (Even my toddler didn't grumble).
My in laws had Bento and they said it was tasty.
So did my niece and nephew with their salmon steak.
The lemon tea was not the instant ones but they did add lemona into the tea (separated sugar). And you can refill the teapot once. On the tea cup's saucer, there was small home made mocha cookies.
My toddler who's always craving for ice cream had strawberry and rhum raisin ice cream. That's a perfect dessert to end the celebration.
Since it was Saturday, there was live music performance by a pianist playing jazzy songs. You can request a song to play to him. (Or even sing on the stage - as my toddler did lol).
This place is suitable for a family gathering or celebrating special occasions. (Not for a regular lunch/dinner).
It's also a nice place for taking pictures. (With the grand stairs connecting the 1st & 2nd floor)"
2371,ChIJ2dX2tM3naC4RG6Gcgz_vyWU,Bawean Resto,can win,5,"A very eye catching spot to visit if you like selfie. Of course you must buy the food here. The place is cozy and the interior is very beautiful. I really love the mocha rhum tart. There are a lot of choices of gelato, my in law's favourite."
2372,ChIJ2dX2tM3naC4RG6Gcgz_vyWU,Bawean Resto,Megawaty Tjoa,5,"My first time visiting Bawean is last week, we celebrated Easter which took place in and Bawean Resto. This place offers a really nice place for family and offices or friends hangout

The interior and decor are designed to gives comfort and coziness to the customers who want to spend 2-4 hours quality time while having lunch and getting a serious conversations

What shocked me is when I see the menu, which offer an affordable price, ranging between 15-25K for the food.

They have many Indonesian local menu, like soto, baso tahu, tahu crispy something, cuanki, as for the international menu is macaroni schotel, fish and chips

Also for kids they have ice creams and Banana Flambe which taste good.

Overall a very pleasant experience in Bawean. Thank you üòä"
2373,ChIJ2dX2tM3naC4RG6Gcgz_vyWU,Bawean Resto,Randy,4,"other than the price, this place was nice, they got rum brownies(super real rum on the inside) . the bagelan (fried pan) was also nice"

2375,ChIJXzqQwUrmaC4RJlZIdEnuJH8,Paviliun Sunda,Andrew Ang,4,"If you're looking for Sundanese food, then this is the place to be. Good food coupled with nice ambience and surroundings makes this the perfect place to wind down all the walking around town. Chill and relax as you sample the various dishes served on the a row of banana leave spread. A little pricey but worth the try."
2376,ChIJXzqQwUrmaC4RJlZIdEnuJH8,Paviliun Sunda,Fuji R. Pelson,5,"One of the best Sundanese restaurant in Bandung, the restaurant ambience very Sundanese because of the design interior, the music they played, the crowd, the food and the taste is good as well. However still have to improved for serving time, still too long."
2377,ChIJXzqQwUrmaC4RJlZIdEnuJH8,Paviliun Sunda,D.S. Munro,5,"This family oriented restaurant has a fine selection of Sundanese dishes. You order the dishes at the buffet, which are then delivered at your table. We picked a whole bunch of dishes, which all tasted excellent! Full of flavor, nice and spicey. Don't skip this, especially if you're curious about Sundanese cuisine!"
2378,ChIJXzqQwUrmaC4RJlZIdEnuJH8,Paviliun Sunda,Bramanto Wijaya,5,"this place sells sundanese (west java) dishes. the food tastes good. they're traditional home dishes. the price might be more expensive than you normally find out there. but considering the ambience of the place, it's worth it.

they have various menus, from proteins to vegetables. i personally like their fried chicken with green chili sambal.

they will assign your seat, after you finish ordering food. we had tried asking to move to other seats, but they said we couldn't do that even though there were many seats available. for me it didn't really matter."
2379,ChIJXzqQwUrmaC4RJlZIdEnuJH8,Paviliun Sunda,Sanne van 't Net,5,We visited Paviliun Sunda twice because of their friendly service and willingness to help us and the great food. Everyone was so kind and sweet. We absolutely loved it! Highly recommended if you‚Äôre looking for vegetarian and vegan options and kind staff.
2380,ChIJTyC3j8rnaC4RQ2JS9b3JBvE,Karnivor Restaurant,Sandy,5,"Good option for a steak. We ordered tenderloin steak with BBQ sauce. The meat is tender but not juicy served with a lot of french fries. The service is OK. The place is comfortable to chill with friends or family. And the price is affordable, for a 3 portion of steaks and drinks we spent not more than 400k."
2381,ChIJTyC3j8rnaC4RQ2JS9b3JBvE,Karnivor Restaurant,Hasna Fauziyah,5,"I love the coffee rubbed steak, price never lies, this menu is the best one after i try sirloin, tenderloin. The meat is so soft and juicy, i love mushroom sauce with mashed potato. The mushroom sauce is extraordinary tasty. The place is very large, there's plenty of non smoking and smoking seats area. This place is always crowded in the weekend. I think you should doing reservation."
2382,ChIJTyC3j8rnaC4RQ2JS9b3JBvE,Karnivor Restaurant,maulana wibowo,5,"Not bad for the menu varieties, tastes are good as well, tender meat, good variety souses n fries. Unique western restaurant's theme, good seating arrangements, but several tables are not too high so our knees can't lay under the table"
2383,ChIJTyC3j8rnaC4RQ2JS9b3JBvE,Karnivor Restaurant,Martiana Sipahutar,4,This was my second visit to Karnivor. It is spacious with many tables. I like that it provides enough space between tables. The chicken wings were nice and not so spicy. The tenderloin was not so tender but suited the price. Veggies were fresh
2384,ChIJTyC3j8rnaC4RQ2JS9b3JBvE,Karnivor Restaurant,M Nurwiseso Wibisono,5,"No question about this place. One of the best steakhouse around bandung! Portion wise it is above average for indonesian (worth the price). You can request on how the steak will be done. Been here alot of times in 2015ish and the taste still consistent. The ambience is one of a kind (jungle-like place) kinda fancy and cozy.

If you are craving for steaks, this place is one of your option."
2385,ChIJPTRbitjnaC4RV1Fox_lQg_0,The Restaurant at The Trans Luxury Hotel Bandung,Gusti Ayu Sinta,5,"Located at the third floor of Trans Hotel Bandung. They provide buffet service for lunch at a price of 300k rupiah per person. Tasty food, especially the salmon and sapo tahu, and the desserts (cake, vanilla cube ice cream) are satisfying. They also have private lunch room with certain minimum spent. Good services, communicative staff. Please do a reservation before coming."

2387,ChIJPTRbitjnaC4RV1Fox_lQg_0,The Restaurant at The Trans Luxury Hotel Bandung,Roby Gultom,5,I love the food and the services. This place is good for people who search for the taste and service and not really make prices as a consideration

2390,ChIJr8LAK7f8aC4RFAgksf1ccQM,Sindang Reret Bandung,Muhammad El-Saeed,4,"Good, the mojito juice that has lychee and strawberry  is really great, they also provide a free tea

Actually I didn't like the fried fish because I used to peel it and it's not possible to peel, and I realized that people here like it like that, eating the bones and skin so it's not an issue, it's a personal issue.

The meat was good but a little spicy. So make sure you like the spicy food or order it. Because we already ordered the food without any hit spices.

The gado gado was wonderful, and the penut sauce us really great, tasty and smells so fresh.

The place was noisy, maybe because there was gathering for a company on the same day.

It's suitable for family or couples, but for a single person it will be a little boring"
2391,ChIJr8LAK7f8aC4RFAgksf1ccQM,Sindang Reret Bandung,ouranji,5,Reasonable price. Good and fast service. Food tastes great- sate manggarai and gurame goreng is recommended. Crowded even on weekdays. Good for a group of 4 to 18 people.
2392,ChIJr8LAK7f8aC4RFAgksf1ccQM,Sindang Reret Bandung,Canal Dobon,5,All dishes were so delicious. The both  interior and exterior are incredible. All staff are so friendly. I started to like Indonesian food since then. Only souvenir shop is looked cheaper.
2393,ChIJr8LAK7f8aC4RFAgksf1ccQM,Sindang Reret Bandung,clara vipassana,2,"I expect something more from a restaurant in a ""so-called"" resort. The seating is rather unique as they have a table on a boat & surrounded by fish pond.

But due to that probably, the flies are too much, and they're wild, they're not even afraid with our lit up candles ü•≤

The food was bad. We ordered Gurame goreng, udang bakar madu & tauge. They're not fresh (except for the bean sprouts), lack of taste, and the supposed-to-be honey on the shrimps are not even glazy at all.

The service is okay, the waitresses are nice but not very fast respond & have initiatives, but still okay."
2394,ChIJr8LAK7f8aC4RFAgksf1ccQM,Sindang Reret Bandung,Doddy Juli Irawan,5,"Sindang Reset, taste of Bumi Parahyangan. Great taste of sundanese food with various recipes. They provide main course such as Ayam Bakar, Gurami Asam Manis, Udang/ Seafood, Sayur Asam, Tumis Kangkung, etc. They also serve fresh juice and different taste of traditional drinks. The price is affordable and their facilities are great (parking, toilet, praying room). Really enjoy the athmosphere here."
2395,ChIJdQqkHT7maC4RmyyxbA6uBLE,Purnawarman Restaurant,Swan S,5,"We stayed in Hilton several times already and everytime nothing but good impressions. Breakfast in Purnawarman has large spread, they always include local delicacies. Special thank you for Aa Iwan for helping us on breakfast time."
2396,ChIJdQqkHT7maC4RmyyxbA6uBLE,Purnawarman Restaurant,Jaden-Lee Gabriel Shane Siauw,5,I got the breakfast here for free because I purchased the 1 Night+Breakfast Package. The Food was Delicious. This place is worthy for a 5 star rating.
2397,ChIJdQqkHT7maC4RmyyxbA6uBLE,Purnawarman Restaurant,Lucy Jap,3,"Those who had buffet at the time we  ate there, were much at better service.

While we who dined-in and ordered much more expensive meals were served terribly. No waitress ever came and checked on us, unless there were called.
Food came more than 1 hr later, drinks too. We asked waitresses to serve at least the drinks first, several times, they only said yes ma'am sorry, we're doing it, but still the drinks came more than 40 mnt.

The steak is not great either.. i ordered medium, it came hard and well done.

Better spend your money at other fancy restaurants. Service is terrible, it seems that the resto has shortage of workers or they're just not attentive enough."

All are great, especially the middle eastern and ‚Äúkambing guling‚Äù or grilled goat was a highlight. They even have durians, the only downside was the lack of drinks option (note: this was for Ramadan and I‚Äôm not sure about the rest of the year on the variety)"
2399,ChIJdQqkHT7maC4RmyyxbA6uBLE,Purnawarman Restaurant,Kathia,5,"Hilton Purnawarman Restaurant is a great place to be with your loved ones.

The steaks were good, cooked as per ordered although the preps took longer time than similar class steakhouse. The soup was served at the same time of the main course. The cost is medium, comparable with the meat quality."

Nice ambience and the vibe feels like nice old house. Authentic colonial building. The menu's various. The price is very normal, comparing to the size and taste of the food. Very warm service and take a bit more time for the staffs response to our request, but still fine. Definitely a good recommendation for family event. The have several rooms where you can have more private small event."
2406,ChIJR5gv3UjmaC4RPaHFVdjX3YA,Dakken Restaurant,Rudi Wang,4,I came here for having lunch and dine in with my friends. This restaurant is quite cozy and I like its ambiance.

It is rarely found (nowadays) that a hotel intensely put serious concern on the food taste while spreading as wide as possible food choices on their buffet.

2433,ChIJpWhkYRXmaC4REHyC-PncG9c,Rijsttafel Resto,Adipati Julian Sutisnawinata,4,"One of Bandung's classics--oldies but goodies--you can tell from the decor.

Rijsttafel offers Dutch colonial fusion cuisines, a nice alternative since it is quite rare but at the same time Bandung has some of the best place, including Rijsttafel Resto.

This place is perfect for breakfast, a nice cullinary treat to start your day.

2434,ChIJpWhkYRXmaC4REHyC-PncG9c,Rijsttafel Resto,Sandra Salzani,3,"The place had old style interior with no aircon installed. Luckily the weather was nice when I visited. Tried ayam bekakak but it's not to my liking. Also tried gado-gado and it's just so-so. Tried nasi liwet and it's okay for me. Also tried chicken satay and it's actually nice. Also ordered bitterballen and croquette but since it's small and too few, it's gone in a flash because that's the best of all menus that I tried.

I don't know whether to recommend this place for a hangout place or for proper lunch. I think none of both. But the snacks were really nice though."
2435,ChIJawtYCDXmaC4RVol2ECy4yRY,Sonoma Cafe|Resto (Sonoma Gold),Kelvin Adrian,5,"The one of well known steak resto, I recommend this place to eat steak. You can choose local or Australian meat, and got some choice besides steak to eat, like a burger. The place is comfy, got indoor and outdoor. Got some nice spot to take a pic if you want. The price is relatively high, but I think it's worth it when thinking about the taste, place, and service."
2436,ChIJawtYCDXmaC4RVol2ECy4yRY,Sonoma Cafe|Resto (Sonoma Gold),Teddy Hatadjie,5,"Taste : Satisfying, Okay presentation

Price : a bit too steep, but worth it

Menu : Lots of variety

Ambience : Well designed interior, lots of theme, fit for a small party, separated non & smoking area

Location : a bit hard to find, because the Resto logo is small and faded, less illumination

Parking Space : Small

Service : Quick, nice, knowledgeable

Revisit : Yes"

Steak is pretty good, with good quality meat, it‚Äôs tender and juicy. Nice texture of mashed potato.
Decent caesar salad‚Äôs flavor, nothing special, but still ok.
They give a warm fluffy complimentary garlic bread too.
Staffs mostly serve us with a warm hospitality.
Price quite affordable, will definitely come to try another menu."

2440,ChIJYSa0w8LmaC4RCQhSEjQErqU,The Restaurant - Padma Hotel Bandung,Jeffrey Alvin,4,"Great atmosphere and service, ok level food. But you pay for the atmosphere.

Steak cut too thin, prefer a narrow thicker cut than wide and thin.
Mashed potatoes taste like instant (I thought it was fluffy n buttery type)
Pasta is ok"
2441,ChIJYSa0w8LmaC4RCQhSEjQErqU,The Restaurant - Padma Hotel Bandung,Jeffry William,5,"One of the best breakfast buffet I have ever had. Waiter services was exemplary and very attentive. Food options are absolutely mind blowing. I can hardly think of other top hotel chains which offer such a vast array of food options for its breakfast. Kolak pisang, bubur candil, manggis, noodle station, western food, japanese food, egg station, everything is there, and some more.

Look forward to be back here again in future. Thank you for the amazing food and services."

So this review is an exception. The Restaurant Padma Hotel breakfast spread deserves my review and my compliment. Seriously, hats off standing ovation for the chef and the team.

I had the best gulai pucuk labu (pumpkin leaves curry), nasi uduk and stir fry black mushrooms, stir fry beef with green tomatoes, beef and radish soup (as good as Soto Pak Simon).

Traditional food at best üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª including the ketan hitam and traditional snacks

I'm amazed how everything are cooked to perfection. And I do hope The Restaurant will uphold this cooking standard.

My family ordered all recommended main course (nasi goreng bali and Rawon) The taste is pretty good, and have reasonable price with nice portion of food though. The spices for ayam goreng is nicely marinated, but for nasi goreng its need more ""savoury"" and should use ""left over rice"" (nasi pera in Indonesia). The Rawon portion is nice and have a plenty of meat chunks in it, but the sambal is too tangy and not compatible for Rawon. Overall its recommended for bandung citizen or tourist that want to try Javanese cuisine."
2448,ChIJg3qxVkDmaC4RInFihzM44MQ,Warung Suluh Restaurant,Jia Hui Chung,5,"had the bebek (duck) sambal matah & battered tofu bites which were mind-blowing~ both were salty but i lovedd it. if u want something less salty could go for the fried rice. really chill atmosphere too, will certainly visit again!"

Food will be served on to your table once you have picked the dishes from a selection of meat or vegetables in a buffet-like style, and paid at the counter. There‚Äôs a wide variety of meat (fish, chicken, lamb, duck and beef) and vegetables. Food is fairly tasty. Cleanliness is alright. The only qualms is that the steam rice is not our preference because the grains are hard, not as soft as the usual steam rice."

I think originally it's a vintage house which is made into a resto.
You can pick your spot : semi outdoor terrace, side terrace, semi outdoor backyard, near a vintage stairs with small door almost loke the one in HarPot.
You pick your own menu here.
They have large varieties of menu.
Be patient to queue as picking the menu is also fun. Just wait for your turn.
Yummy yummy food on banana leaf... No plate needed.

Try roasted iga/chicken instead of fried ones.

Love love.."

I loved the interior the presented and also the ordering sequences. A square space, with full of staff ready to take the order of the food as you like.
When i got there, it was too crowded. Super busy, and the service delivery was taken too long, some pre cooked dishes that i took from the counter were waiting at our table too long due to waiting for cooked dishes."

I would recommend to have a reservation first since its always crowded, especially after their renovation. Their coffee is great, but did not expect the vanilla ice cream on top (there isn‚Äôt any information in the menu). I love their apple crumble even though it was very sweet when you include the caramel topping. The cooked apple sauce was tender and sour, just the way I like it‚ú® the crumbs were crunchy and buttery. Would go back to try their main dish!"
2456,ChIJaa4yq0vmaC4Rlp_TQ2P0LHY,Hummingbird Eatery & Space,Shinta Wardhani,5,"New building new ambience. Lots of beautiful spots, huge space, plenty of seats, only minus kid's playground. Food is great (despite of it's considerably high price), especially spaghetti carbonara. Generous mushroom and smoked beef toppings completed with a runny yolk are heaven.

One issue is that parking can get a little difficult at times since the place can get pretty full, but there are plenty of roadside parking in the area."
2459,ChIJaa4yq0vmaC4Rlp_TQ2P0LHY,Hummingbird Eatery & Space,Putri A. Smit,5,"I know this place because there are lots of reviews by young people. So I recommend to friends to meet there. The location is in the center of Bandung, the parking area is quite large, the concept is minimalist consisting of indoor and outdoor areas and clean toilets. Staff are friendly and responsive. Easy disability access. The menu has a wide variety and everything is delicious. In my opinion the place is only suitable for hanging out with friends and family and not suitable for work. But I like the ambience. I will come here again next time, i like it!

Its a hotpot place. Yes service is good. Yes place is spacious. Yes Tom Yum Soup is delicious. But

Dishes in their menu is too expensive. Its Singapore prices The dumplings all taste the same. The veggie too expensive...

Felt like I paid $30 for 10 dumplings that was cooked in Tom yum soup... Hence my title review - my regret.

I recommend eating something else."

I only ordered the dim sums and they finally be served for like 20-30 minutes and the taste is quite good but also quite pricey (i suggest buy voucher on traveloka).

These 2 appetizers make us full enough and could be alternatives for you who not order steaks here. Nacho was served in guacamole, cheese souce and sour cream. Rich taste and matched combination between crisp chips and moist meat toppings. The salad was presented in 7-8 pcs of fried fish, various vegetables, and seasoned with sesame dressing.

You have to try the nacho, definitely worth for the 5 stars.

PS: Glosis has plenty of parking spaces and seating spots. There's also 2 restos (Five Monkey Burger and Lula Bakery & Coffee) in the same area."

for taste, i think it's typical from old established store (let's call it legendary...heheh), which is rather bland to my taste, but still acceptable. bakmoy is good, neither too strong nor bland. godzilla bread which tastes like pizza bread is okay, ice cream is delightfully tasty, coffee? err i'd rather have one from real cafe/coffee shop. overall it's still a good place to hang out with your friends and family."

It had such a wonderful vibe at night, perfect for a romantic dinner. The waiter was spectacular, had great manners and served us very quickly.

What I ordered for food:
1. Chipotle Pizza: the dough is so light and easy to eat. They also give a generous amount of cheese and topping. Perfect for sharing!

2. Chicken katsu curry: even though the portion is a lot, the curry and chicken taste bland. Need to add salt for it to taste ‚Äúdecent‚Äù

3. Niku Miso Ramen: again, the portion is big. The noodle is perfectly cooked, the niku is thin sliced. However, the miso based is bland‚Ä¶ need to put salt‚Ä¶

4. Bbq chicken steak: the steak is perfectly cooked and taste superb! The bbq sauce is thick and tasty!

5. Aus Meltique Steak: we ordered it with the mushroom sauce. The steak is tender and juicy. Portion wise, it‚Äôs quite small but enough if you don‚Äôt like to eat too much.

6. Amiyaki Steak: the best of the best! The sauce was made from garlic and a thick soy based? The steak is sooo tender and juicy! Definitely must try!

For the drinks, we decided to take the ice tea jug. Just a head up, they don‚Äôt have es teh tawar, so it‚Äôs es teh manis.

Definitely will come back to this place to try the other menu! But probably try not to order the japanese food."

2540,ChIJ5XTisirmaC4Rcvp7ZxbDoX8,Rose Flower Restaurant,Agatha Claudia,3,"Whenever in Bandung, I would eat kangkung hotplate, usually I ate at Ah*ng, roadside chinese food, but this time, decided to try a certain chinese resto recommend by a certain blogger.

Parking spot are not too hard, parking is within the road side, and the road is big. Not much could say for interior since this is an old type chinese restaurant. Place are spacious has many tables.

They serve full and half portion which is a point plus for me.

We order the kangkung hotplate (IDR 65k) half portion, portion are enough for two people, taste sweet savory, generous fillings of beef and quail egg. This is probably the only decent dish I've ordered here.

The cingkong (IDR 100k ish) half portion consist of 4, is nothing but a tiny bit of crab meat coated with crab cake dough and sweet red sauce . Texture of the dough is hard and cold, barely any crab meat, very fishy , kinda lack seasoning the sauce didn't help.

The udang telur asin (IDR 100k ish ) for half portion consist of 4 big prawn. This is the worse experience I've had in Bandung. The prawn dish is the type of the prawn not peeled and just directly dip into the batter and deep fried, makes the prawn looks big but actually not. The telur asin is definitely not the salty egg sauce you meet everyday, like literally the real telur asin, fried and crumbled into pieces poured over the shrimp.  Which is okay for me. But the prawn is not properly clean, and there is blue color as in picture , I feel disgust already, not feel like eating it anymore.  And this prawn is so tasteless , the fried egg didn't even help seasoning it.  And since I'm the type of person that eats peeled shrimp, this is not for me.

The waiters when asked why the color blue, he just casually said ""I DONT KNOW""

And the madam at the casher makes excuses as if saying "" it's not our fault, sometimes it is just bad luck finding prawn like that among hundreds of prawn we cook, not poisonous just color ""
hellow, I pay for your food here, not eating it free. And imagine eating something you usually see white flesh, has blue color within it.

Gosh, definitely wont came back here ever.
If not because of the Kangkung Hotplate, I would have rate it 1, 0 if possible.

Many other chinese restaurant here in Bandung, and should better explore other.
This restaurant might be too cocky because of a certain food blogger loves it, but definitely doesn't fool me."
2541,ChIJ5XTisirmaC4Rcvp7ZxbDoX8,Rose Flower Restaurant,octa,5,"One of my fave nostalgic restaurant in my hometown. They were famous for fried noodles, cingkong, kepiting saos tiram, and kangkung cah sapi. Unfortunately my most fave dish - kepiting saus tiram was out of stock when I visited. Kangkung beef was still tasty, a little bit saltier than before, but still good. Cingkong was made from prawn and crab meat. The sauce lacks flavour to enrich the taste of cingkong. However, cingkong itself was already delicious without the sauce. Fried noodle was the star for me and reminded me to my childhood."
2542,ChIJ5XTisirmaC4Rcvp7ZxbDoX8,Rose Flower Restaurant,Crochet X,5,"We have been here for many2 years. We especially loved their ""Kepiting Saos Tiram"" (crab in oyster sauce), Boiled Prawns, ""Kangkung Hotplate"". Just go to this restaurant and try them yourself."

It serves wide-range foods from Western, Italian, and various regions in Indonesia, things that only few competitors have. Love the taste, the portion, its atmosphere, and also the prices.
Recommended menus based on my experiences: tenderloin cheese steak, beef lmentelar, black paper beef spaghetti (I forget its actual name), and garang asam beef oxtail/ribs."
2547,ChIJ9RgV6c7naC4RFa2HeJrbdt0,Cafe Bali,Svante Hansson,4,Perhaps a bit over the top decoration but very different vibe coming in here compared to outside. Lots of food option and the soto ayam was tasty.

The staffs were really nice, i brought my little brother which was a toddler and all the staffs were being really nice to him and i appreciated it. I just enjoyed my meal withouth worrying where would my little brother run because they staffs were looking after him (i didn‚Äôt ask). I can‚Äôt say the food was pricey bacause i enjoyed the meal myself, worth it lahya. But the cake was a little bit stodgy it was a bit hard to cut. But overall, would definitely come here again!"

The sauce is still good as old.. but??!! What's wrong with the taste of the meat and vegetable!! It was not worth with the price that i must pay (well i gladly use brizzi for 50% discount) so i have to say sorry to give ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ for this food..

The sop buntut bakar is good ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

2571,ChIJ6XtKddDnaC4RNcIJMfp8Ibo,Tilu Kitchen and Patisserie,Miranti Vidyasari,4,"Most of dishes are relatively good. Good plating and presentation.
It comes and serve in a big portion, it is worth it, considering the price.

The salmon soup (forget the name), the soup has a freshness balance flavor, it‚Äôs resemblance Tom Yum Soup. Pasta dishes cooked perfectly. Nasi campur just ok, big portion, though. Thai Beef Salad is very sweet, it‚Äôs lack freshness on acid/sour flavor.
Tried their kouign amman, it‚Äôs good and flaky and buttery, chocolate croissant is just ok. Chocolate filling isn‚Äôt chocolatey enough.
Will try another one.

Place is comfy enough. Toilet is super clean."

I never tried their regular menu though"

2574,ChIJ6XtKddDnaC4RNcIJMfp8Ibo,Tilu Kitchen and Patisserie,Seen Love,4,"We went to lunch here based on my niece's suggestion. I'm glad we did. We were promptly seated; I think because it was 11:30 AM. We were seated in a smaller sitting area but we were the only ones in this section.

Our food was served quickly starting with the drinks. I had a sweet tea with a Oreo Vanilla shake. I'm still in a quest for a great shake in Indonesia. This one was pretty good but still not what I'm looking for. Fitri had a peach tea which she liked. Feby ordered a Green Tea Tarik. It looked good and she liked it.

Fitri ordered Mie Goreng Jawa which she couldn't finish from the size. Fitri asked for spicy but it fell a little short so you may want to specify. Feby ordered Spaghetti Aglio Olio. Again, it was a large portion and it must have been good because it was completely finished. I ordered the Caesar Salad Smoked Salmon and mushroom soup (not the official name). The soup came in a bread bowl and the salad was good size as well. I should have ordered one or the other based on size alone. The flavor was great on both.

I recommend trying this restaurant, but be careful not to over-order based on portion size. We'll be back for sure. There were two appetizers we wanted to try, but they were out of them. I'm kind of glad so we have a reason to return and we would have had to bring a lot of food home."

This restaurant also serve Dim Sum in the morning. The variety aren't much, but taste great.

If you're looking for a Chinese family restaurant, this place is one the best to visit in Bandung.

Quite big portion for me, quite overprized. Cheese sambosa was great too, the cheese was okay and the sambosa was crispy. Arabic champagne was very fresh after having the meal, it got apples and lemons in it. We also ordered arab tea which was strong black tea and mint, was great too. The ambient was kinda great very spacious place, private, and the staffs were very helpful and nice. They also served quite fast. You also can pay here cardless, i used qris. The place was quiet (not lot of people were there). But we wondered why they played indo music there, we thought they would play arabic music.

Their menus are quite varied from vegetarian options, chicken/lamb meat, curry, beverages like coffee, tea, and juices, heck there are some western options if you don't know what to order. All menus available are attached in my reviews. I got Ruz Mandhi Lamb, Mixed Idam (Curry), and two mojitos and they were absolutely great. Payment options are available in form of cash, debit/CC, but I can't make sure if they have any payment point avail. I like their gesture too of including disabled parking area/entrance/venue.

Greeted by some staff and the Big Red Bull statue at the front of the restaurant entrance.

We sit on a secluded area near the open kitchen and the chef invited us to choose some aged beef inside the kitchen, really a great moment.

We order two kinds of beef and a plate of fish menu, for some side dishes we order french fries ,mashed potato and salad

The meat, mashruom, shrimps and vegetables were really good and high quality

The ambiance was really comfortable, also the bathroom and mushallah really clean and organized.

The restaurant is really clean, it was noisy but maybe because it was my bad luck, because they were hosting a birthday gathering.

The food is delicious.

Breakfast is usually an all you can eat package.

There is lontong soto betawi, delicious.

There is an omelet, you can choose whatever it contains according to your taste.

Various juice drinks, plain/cold water.

Chicken porridge, and the toppings are really complete.

Refreshing yogurt.

Bread with delicious jam.

There is a la carte too.

Australian fed grain beef tenderloin, ordered medium but not too juicy, even richer to well done. But it's still delicious. The mushroom sauce is really runny, but the taste is still ok. I really like the potato wedges, crunchy, tasty, soft on the inside, really delicious. Overall ok. Price 195k before tax n service.

Fresh watermelon juice, delicious, really fresh, it just seems like there's a rough texture from the watermelon, the sweetness isn't too much. Price 50k before tax n service."

If you look for delicious food with value for money, THIS is the place. All food we had here came in generous portion and tasted very good. Thou the name suggests potato-based cuisine, you can find pretty much everything here. Our fave is always the ribs; very juicy and tender.

Nice place to bring your friends and family. The parking area is also large enough. In the night, it usually have a live music, a little bit loud for anyone who wants to have quiet dinner. But it is still nice though.

The food is a little under the expectation. I came in the night, so some menus were not available. I tried aglio olio pasta. It was a bit dry and too spicy, though the portion was big, there was just little amounts of small prawns. The lemon tea is good, but not a special one. Baked potato is also delicious.

I ordered the green chili duck, the duck was crispy and the meat didn't have a lot of fat, the chili sauce was just right, not too spicy. The price is average compare the quality of food, restaurant space and parking lot big enough."

The restaurant is quite spacious, the tables available at this restaurant are quite a lot, so you don't have to worry about not getting any. Talking about food, the buffet menu is quite a lot, a lot of originals. I can't taste all of the food either, there's so much of it. The food that is available is delicious.

What a coincidence when I was there, just when I was launching ""Media Corner"". This spot was specially made by the hotel for media friends and bloggers who want to relax or while working here. Free wi-fi and coffee and tea 24 hours looooh. Wow..... cool"

It's a nice place to spend the special night with your special one. The service is great, as well. The foods are classified as fine dining grade.

2644,ChIJyRkfYIbmaC4RVa2Z3C770TY,Goldstar 360,Jer M,4,"First time coming here. From the information at the elevator, cave was at 3rd floor, rooftop at 5th floor. When we came at the 3rd floor, it was pitch black and seemed empty. Turned out the cafe was at the 5th floor. Maybe they had relocated the cafe from the 3rd floor because the place at the 5th floor was not the same with some of the older pictures from the reviews.

The view was nice at night. The staff was nice. I didn‚Äôt order any food at the time, but the drinks were just okay."

Tips : this resto serve Indonesian food. It‚Äôs very unique that you will not find this kind of food in other Indonesian resto in somewhere else. Taste is delicious, unique preservation, and the ambience is very nice. One thing is the minus is parking.

Always follow my reviews, it's trusted and objective"

Food was very very enjoyable. Nice touch with complimentary traditional appetizers. Pleasant atmosphere, the interior was very well thought. Suitable for family and office gathering. The only let down is the water flow in sink was too strong creating splashes. Other than that it is very recommended to dine here."

Have the best experience with grilling the meat by ourselves, make sure we can eat the BBQ at its best temperature.

Nice atmosphere too, crowded but still spacy and could get the privacy we need."
2657,ChIJtyt56UHmaC4R_v-kAif1nLE,Bornga Korean Restaurant,Nathania Hermawan Liem,2,"Went for a family dinner on the second day of CNY and I must say I felt pretty disappointed with the service of the staff.

We made a reservation for 8 people during dinner time & the staff who received our call was very attentive. However, the staff who attended to our table were not as attentive as we would like them to be. When we arrived, the place was not as crowded but no one came to our table and we had to call a few times just for them to pass our call to another waiter. This happened a few times & we had to wait for a good 10 minutes to get a menu. And when we wanted to order, the same thing happened again & the staff was more focused on attending to other tables.

If they did not want to attend to us, they should not have accepted our reservation.

The food was great but the service definitely made us not want to return to this place."

Especially niku udon was a perfection same like in japan the broth very strong and tasty also the noodle very smooth. For salmon teriyaki for me a bit overprice because the taste not so special slightly burnt and bitter but for gindara teriyaki was good. Overall this place acceptable good menu variations, tasty."

It has a small mushalla upstair
The service is actually okay but being charged for an extra tiny plate of Gari (ginger) while we ordered a big plate of sushi platter which came with only two tiny plates of gari & wasabi? That is something üòÇ

Can sit with a view overlooking the independent street (Bandung Indah Plaza). The service is very good, fast, neat, organized and the staff is friendly. Yesterday, I tried the steamboat package for 4 people for Rp. 200,000 with a complete package there is a cake too. The cake has red velvet and green tea cake which is really delicious. For the steamboat package, there are chicken, fish, beef, shrimp and vegetables which are all fresh. To drink there is mineral water and guava juice. Definitely give rice too. For the gravy there are 2 kinds, tomyum and the other one I forgot. Both broths are delicious and fresh. Overall the food is delicious and will be suitable for birthdays, maybe you can eat with friends or family. The steamboat package itself can be ordered from Traveloka or myfave. Will definitely come back here to eat the steamboat."

2684,ChIJjSjsbBPmaC4RqDtVY2z2Xpc,the WindChime,Arvin Tanu,5,"Two words: THE BEST.
Absolutely the best fine dining in Bandung. Their food is top notch. We ordered escargot, foie gras, butcher‚Äôs wife, nolan sirloin, spaghetti aglio, and we closed it off with hot. Choc. Truffle. Everything they served is AMAZING. Their steak‚Äôs sauce is different from anyhing i have tried. The fois grass easily the best in Bandung. Their aglio tasted very expensive in layers. I love this resto vibe as well. Very respectful to the fine dinning lovers. Overall, definitely will come back here more often."
2685,ChIJjSjsbBPmaC4RqDtVY2z2Xpc,the WindChime,bart speelman,5,"Lovely dinner experience!
In this lovely city there‚Äôs an abundance of eateries. None however as unique as The Windchime.
Located in the area Pasirkaliki in Bandung, this charming restaurant has been in operation since 2017. Before 2017, chef Felix had a venue in Dago from 2005 till 2013. Chef Felix is originally from the island of Ambon.
As you walk in you immediately understand this restaurant‚Äôs main focus is on the ‚Äòlove for food‚Äô. The ambience is minimalistic and calming. No unnecessary frills. Let‚Äôs sit down and have a good glass of wine and enjoy whatever the chef will bring us. And maybe find out who he is ‚Ä¶
We did just that !
We had each two starters, main course and desert. The two salads on the menu, seared scallop and escargot. All absolutely delicious. Then we had smoked duck breast and Norwegian trout. Equally delicious. We had the hot chocolate truffle for desert. Absolutely yummy.
We can tell the chef has his own language with food recipes. A very subtle approach he has.
Obviously a well-trained staff in the kitchen with an equal passion for food. Thank you, WindChime for a lovely night. Will definitely come back."

2687,ChIJjSjsbBPmaC4RqDtVY2z2Xpc,the WindChime,Y W (Carry Crystal Maiden),5,"This is the ""don't judge a book by its cover"" restaurant. Yes it is a small restaurant run by a family, but the plating of each food is artsy. The ribeye and flat iron is good and cooked to perfection, but the sauce is marvelous. It is a smooth sauce but has a unique mix of taste in it. Their mashed potato have a mild taste but extremely smooth texture, one of the smoothest i've ever tasted.

Before you order anything, make sure to ask the speciality of the day. I would've ordered a rack of lamb had i known there were a speciality of the day."
2688,ChIJt7U8K4gWei4RymxgX-AtF7U,Saffron Resto & Meatshop,HS MXH,5,"Very Good. All the sauces are made from scratch, not from some instant flavoring.

Potato soup and Mushroom soup are good.

Chef  and Caesar Salads are good. Greek Salad not so, because they don't have feta cheese and dressing is too sour.

Penne Pesto is good.
Spicy tomato spaghetti is too sweet as if the sauce was made from ketchup.

Steak is very good. Chicken Parmigiano is okay, maybe it can use some sauce and the chicken fillet doesn't have to be that thick.
Mashed potato and baby potatoes are good."
2689,ChIJt7U8K4gWei4RymxgX-AtF7U,Saffron Resto & Meatshop,Adelisa Devita,5,"Serve tasty western cuisines, suitable for you who looks wants to satisfy your tongue. Very affordable for this kind of taste. Although the restaurant is not really big, it is comfy and clean."

It should be 5 stars food, but came here Saturday night, so hectic, full of people, and the food here, first selat segar, no fork and knife nor spoon. Then came steak lidah, still no fork and spoon at all. And then, the drinks and ice cream came. Who serve ice cream when the main hasn't been eaten because the customer had no spoon, fork, nor knife at all.

Then we came down to ask for spoons, forks, or knives. They apologize, they forgot that we haven't had any utensils.

If you want ice cream after meals, ask specifically to serve it later, or order ice cream separately later.

So after waiting for the spoon, and finishing the main course, we ate the ice cream. Nougat. It has melted."

Misua was excellent,  the star of the dish is definitely the broth. It's so 'chickeny', flavourful, and tasted very nutritious. The broth reminded me a lot to a double-boiled Chinese chicken & tofu skin soup my dad used to make.

I also ordered the kuotie. Again excellent!
Crispy at the bottom but soft everywhere else, and it exploded with broth inside, like xiao long bao. The only thing missing is ginger & black vinegar. It was served with vinegar but white vinegar & rather sweet.

Worth the money, excellent Chinese food. Will definitely come back to try other things."

Solo food portion is small and on the sweeter or spicier side. What I like about it is that it give you opportunity to try something else since the portion is not for NBA players. We got to try the super duper sweet dessert afterwards.

The service is nice as the people here are soft-spoken and well mannered, the best part of this area. The best part of Indonesians and it should be like this everywhere.

2799,ChIJp84m9QkXei4ROK1PUNa36vs,Jinju Korean Eatery,Novita Wulandari,3,"So I bumped into this place as I was really craving for korean food in Solo. Viewing its instagram account, honestly I had high expectations as it said its cook is korean. When entering the place, you will surely be greeted with korea atmosphere (including the music and the ""Anyeong"" ""Kamsahamida"" sort of greetings) ‚Äî so if you enjoy this you may pay a visit. It has 2 floors with several options you can choose.

It served me okay with korea-like restaurant (free water) but unfortunately, I'd say I leave 3 stars only as the food was just not kicking in. Maybe they were supposed to taste like that or idk(?) but it was just not my cup of tea ‚Äî I put my expectations too high. Nonetheless, I'd say it is very environment-friendly (no plastic cutleries detected! and appreciate it)."

A few hundred meters to the south of Jalan Slamet Riyadi, in Kampung Batik Kauman to be precise. Even though the road is small and more comfortable if passed by motorized vehicle or on foot, it offers a unique view of ancient buildings. Many shops for batik clothes or batik cloth here. Wesja also provides indoor dining. There is a showroom for batik clothes as well as batik cloth. The building has a quite unique interior, because it is equipped with batik tools, ancient cupboards, and old chairs. So that we can also get to know the raw materials for making batik cloth here. The food menu served is in the form of Javanese dishes such as lontong opor, stir-fried pare, stir-fried bean curd, paklay which changes every day. Drinks include iced tea, chocolate ice, gula tamarind ice, temulawak ice, etc. The outside area has a sink for washing hands, there are unique photo spots too.

When we entered the venue there was no greeting and aircond was still off (so it was kind of humid). Overall the dinning-in service was just enough. Food wise, we ordered sapo tahu, bihun goreng ayam and they taste alright. They did added extra vegie as per requested. However, their gurame asam manis, and ayam saus szechuan had so much flour coating that we hardly bites the meat. I ended pealing off those flour coating. The sauces was nothing special, they are kind of just bottle sauce liquid being reheated and poured over. Not even a szechuan pepper when the menu said so. Price wise...slightly expensive. I heard this place is popular with their breakfast buffet, might give it a try but a comeback for dinner...may be not."

The food was okay. Standard Indonesian fav. The strongest impression that the food left on my tongue is MSG. Very strong.
Price wise it's quite high for Angkringan food. The average spent there is Rp60.000 per pax.

My concern, as always, is cleanliness. Once again, a resto has failed to pay attenton to that specific issue. Especially in the far corner area of the restaurant. The table, the chair, and especially the hanging DIY lamp. So dirty."

2885,ChIJo5l9F4QWei4RXbHWfWvSLdM,Pecel Solo,Fino Indrasaputra,4,"The restaurant has big tables and long chairs, fit for family dining or gatherings. The interior is unique with traditional Javanese touch. The upstairs floor are even more unique. Many variety of Javanese food shown as window display, which is very tempting, but the food tastes are not so special. Price is so so."
2886,ChIJo5l9F4QWei4RXbHWfWvSLdM,Pecel Solo,Just Berry,5,"Love this restaurant. The quintessential Traditional Solo Cuisines, culture, history and architecture. Honestly, the best part of Solo for me, as everything else the city offered weren‚Äôt good for me."
2887,ChIJo5l9F4QWei4RXbHWfWvSLdM,Pecel Solo,Jamal,5,"Great restaurant that serves authentic and delicious local Solo cuisine, decorated top to bottom with very fine Javanese and local furniture and antiques.

While waiting for my dinner of Pecel Solo and Nasi Liwet (which didn't take long), I enjoyed having a look around at all the antique pieces which populated the first floor. If felt like I was at both a gallery and museum.

The food was excellent, and the service was great. Parking was also plentiful. Overall, great experience, and a must dine if you're visiting Solo."
2888,ChIJo5l9F4QWei4RXbHWfWvSLdM,Pecel Solo,Nava K,4,"Where to next? Lunch bell rang and we heading to Restaurant Pecel Solo. My-my! Ambiance really a stand-out. As if you have walked into someone‚Äôs rustic and traditional those days house. Regardless, let me tell you that being seated in the stuffy, cramped dining area and hardly any space breather to move around was not a comfort zone. Food by far too was not a major delicious pop-up. In fact, just so-so and pretty much only acceptable. Pretty much the same like those we have already tucked into in other eateries Maybe those were far out much better. Nevertheless, in all fairness, credit due, not high distinction though, must be credit given right? Rice set meal and dessert were not winners, but did reflect how a traditional Indonesian meal should be."
2889,ChIJo5l9F4QWei4RXbHWfWvSLdM,Pecel Solo,Setiawaty Lukman,5,"Located at Jl. Prof.DR. Supomo, Surakarta. Served very nice authentic javanish food. Nice interior and ambience overall. Unique, classic and very artistic. Old style Javanese house. With the affordable price, you can enjoy the genuinely taste of Javanese food."
2890,ChIJd5Q4fDBYei4RG6uDmHe8xXs,Roaster And Bear Restaurant,Aurora Almarini,4,"Location : 4/5
It‚Äôs located in the center, easy to see from the street, but a little confusing to spot the entrance hahaha because it‚Äôs in the same building as a hotel

Parking Spot : 4/5
Parking area is the same as hotel, even though they can accommodate around 10 cars (probably more) but place like this should expect more visitors with cars especially on weekends

Interior : 5/5
Live up to the theme, and ‚Äúinstagramable‚Äù

Service : 5/5
Each table got QR code and we order from the website. It‚Äôs very convenience. Order via waiter/waitress were possible as well.

Food : 3/5
Personal favourite from my order was mushroom soup. The least favourite was fried tofu because it tastes like fried flour‚ÄîI can‚Äôt taste the tofu at all. Vegetarian option was very limited, the menu didn‚Äôt say if we can ask for vegetarian option. Even meat house nowadays have plant-based menu. We don‚Äôt need special section, just put a symbol or something to indicate that we can ask for vegetarian/vegan option for certain menus

Beverage : 5/5
Can‚Äôt complain about the drinks. It was good.

Price : 3.5/5
It‚Äôs in the center of the city, in the tourist area, and the place was well maintenance. It was a little bit expensive, yes. But I can say, (almost) worth the price.

Non Smoking Area :
Very spacey, great for families or groups, they have a separate section for more private area.

Smoking Area :
Also spacey, but very hot and humid at noon on a sunny days. Better add more fan.

Toilet :
It was clean and didn‚Äôt smell

Other Highlight :
There‚Äôs live music performance on schedule."
2891,ChIJd5Q4fDBYei4RG6uDmHe8xXs,Roaster And Bear Restaurant,Fajar Latif,4,"I visited there to eat some food with friends. We ordered a lot of stuff.

The service is nice, the place is clean. It's good to eat even though the price is a bit pricy. The smoke Wagyu is just so so, a bit sweet for me. The steam is too small.

If you wanna have a nice dinner with a good view this restaurant is recommended."
2892,ChIJd5Q4fDBYei4RG6uDmHe8xXs,Roaster And Bear Restaurant,Adi Kurniawan,5,"One of the best restaurant in Yogyakarta.
Originally I didn‚Äôt think I would have such a lovely ambiance. But here, they have very good food and interesting drinks.

The food was well prepared and had unique tastes. I ordered rice and wagyu with papaya leaves stir fried and that was delicious!

Beers are normal prices for a restaurant; IDR 37.000 for a bottle.

The food were delicious, the services was great, the ambience was comfortable too. I ordered beef ribs, my friends ordered sop buntut and steak. I tried all of them and it was above my expectations. The meat was tender and flavory, and suitable for my taste as well as my Pakistani friend‚Äôs taste. The service also good, we‚Äôre not waited too long, the waitress also can speak English well. There are couple of nice and instagrammable spots if you want to take a photo, so it‚Äôs worth all the money you spent here."

2895,ChIJUQyDGr1Xei4RO5dXFv3bepE,Mediterranea Restaurant by Kamil,Haris Susanto,5,"Awesome experience as usual!

My go to comfort Western Food in Yogyakarta. Service was still the same, very nice and warm. Ambience even though there‚Äôs not much renovation but has that nice home-like feeling. There‚Äôs a separate Smoking areas too for smokers.

We had a lot of food but my personal favourite are the drinks and wines instead. They offer great value Wines and Spirits for you to enjoy your meal with, especially when we ordered a nice classic Pepperoni Pizza.

I‚Äôll always come back and have great meals on this establishment. Price is slightly below average over other high-end Western Restaurant."
2896,ChIJUQyDGr1Xei4RO5dXFv3bepE,Mediterranea Restaurant by Kamil,Erniyati Fun,5,"The food is still number 1 and only favorite in Yogyakarta. We love everything they serve here. Staffs are very nice too. But  the dine in experience went a little off recently. Nothing bad. They still doing a great job and working extremely hard to please everyone which is uneasy. But the fact that this restaurant is always full booked, especially the non smoking area, i recommend you to book at least 2 days before if you want for special occasion. As the restaurant always full, the waiting time for food gets longer too, very acceptable but if you dine with kids or you are too hungry, this can be a little annoying. To me personally, delivery order can be best option if you are in no time, same food taste & quality and less waiting time.
Those all happen because Mediterranea is loved by so many, so with that being said, people obviously come here to eat and enjoy the food. I feel so bad when i see people working from here take their time and chill while many people in the waiting list, waiting for a table. Please have some commonsense and emphaty to others. Cheers"
2897,ChIJUQyDGr1Xei4RO5dXFv3bepE,Mediterranea Restaurant by Kamil,Karenila,4,"This is one was my bucket list in Jogja.

We ordered lots of things here, steak, beef kebab and pizza was really great and delicious.
The waiting time is short, even we ordered a lot of things it comes out quite quick.

The place was nice and they also have a separate parking lot for cars and motorbike.
Pricing was great.
Good to visit!"

Will definitely come back when I visit Yogyakarta."
2899,ChIJUQyDGr1Xei4RO5dXFv3bepE,Mediterranea Restaurant by Kamil,Darrell Wee,5,"This restaurant is strongly recommended for good Mediterranean style food. I was there with a few friends for dinner. We did not make prior reservations and the restaurant was full when we reached at 6.15pm. We had to wait for about 40 minutes before we were allocated a table.

There was a wide range of food to choose from the menu so it was a rough choice. We ordered the escargot, Napoleon pizza, octopus salad and duck confit and others. The food was delicious. Definitely not regretting the visit and wait. Price is definitely reasonable for the quality of the food served.

Strongly recommended if you are in Yogyakarta!"
2900,ChIJ4ymRixtYei4R2fWJtZbN4vs,Gubug Makan Mang Engking Soragan,Timothy Widjaya,5,"A great place to chill and eat. The environment is breezy and nature-like. You could feel the silence of the forest, and also the sound of fishes swimming.

The taste of the food, for me is pretty good, although the price is pretty standard for a tourist spot, and the staffs are nice too.

Overall, its a good place to try out, and it could be said that you‚Äôre paying for the experience (decors, environment, etc)"
2901,ChIJ4ymRixtYei4R2fWJtZbN4vs,Gubug Makan Mang Engking Soragan,Agus Purwantara,4,"Good place for eating out, with pond around the dining hall. Try fish treatment by dipping your feet in the  ponds. It is less friendly place for kids, as the walk ways above the pond are a bit narrow without proper fencing.  The foods are a bit pricey."

Slightly more expensive than other restaurants in the area (dishes above 55K) but it‚Äôs really worth it if you want to try special dishes that most restaurants don‚Äôt offer. We had the Seafood Nais Goreng and it was totally worth it for 60K. Also, the fruit juices are delicious, natural and made at the moment. Service was very slow and they charge a 3% fee for paying with card."

Most of the food are taste so delicious with very good presentation. Mostly the restaurant is quiet because of very limited customers. The services is good but take a bit longer than most restaurant, in my opinion. The price is so expensive but worth it for such a good food, for such a special occasion"

This place shown to me how to manage the culture and culinary in one package. Thanks for Jogja tourism festivals for this chance. The gadri resto have a lot of stories about Jogja, especially the means of keraton's culinary. For students like me, maybe the food prices is more expensive than daily food in around university. But, gadri resto explained that if you want to know and learn about gastronomic tourism, this place could be one of important parts. Thanks for Mrs. Joyo"

2915,ChIJZ4iWXKNXei4RAKfGZhOm_uI,Dapur EL,s v,5,"Food here was excellent and priced very reasonably. I ordered the crispy shrimp in black pepper sauce with a side of their traditional indonesian salad which was so so good. My husband ordered the Nasi goreng and he really enjoyed that too. He said the chicken it came with was cooked to perfection. I also ordered a fresh lemonade that was delicious and so refreshing. I can't remember the name but I'm sure they can figure it out.

Best of all was the staff. We really appreciated how kind and friendly the staff were. They really made us feel at home. Highly recommend!"

Menu prior decided, due to us being a in tour. Still, one of the best picks, in regards to the dishes. We loved all of it, and keropok for nibbling before the rest of dishes arriving, almost simultaneously, one after the other. Sambal, fried stuffs, raw salad, stir fried veggies, fried chicken, sweet sour fish, and fresh fruits and buah salak for dessert. Especially for someone like me, who love Indonesian food, this first meal of ours must be stated as the winner."
2925,ChIJ38IqyaNXei4R-Nkurx7opBA,ViaVia Jogja,Ayi,3,"I think pastas are just the best choice at this restaurant. That's my best recommendation here. The other menu such as the Indonesian food and the choices under the  ""world kitchen"" section are much less recommended.

As of the ambience, the second floor is quite nice esp if you just want to have your me time. The wifi connection is really good, so it can make a good place for 'work from cafe'."
2926,ChIJ38IqyaNXei4R-Nkurx7opBA,ViaVia Jogja,Ronald L. Poetranto,5,"This is one of most well known place in Yogyakarta, especially for western peeps around Prawirotaman area. They served many kind of foods. Indonesian, Western, and Asian in general. The price was very very reasonable. Imho opinion, the taste is ok, but for sure it‚Äôs made for western taste buds. The ambience of this place reminds me alot to Bali. But, again, if you have a spare time, make sure to make a visit to chill (with beer and friends too)."
2927,ChIJ38IqyaNXei4R-Nkurx7opBA,ViaVia Jogja,Erniyati Fun,2,"We came here because we saw 2000+ great review on google maps and other sites. We expected the same but we got completely otherwise. We understand, with pandemic, it has been difficult year for everyone including the tourism. I believe this place was a great restaurant before. But this review is based on our own, very honest experience.
The food presentation and portion look very good and tempting. But the taste was a little off to no taste. My iga bakar sup taste nearly like water with some grease. Mu husband ordered sapi sambal matah, he got so little beef but a lot of side dish, one of that many side dish, not sure what was that was so bitter, smells like basil, may be it was like saut√©ed green basil with coconut, but so weird. The lime squash, we sure it was off. That was the worse dinner experience during our stay in Yogyakarta. Price is fairly cheap though."
2928,ChIJ38IqyaNXei4R-Nkurx7opBA,ViaVia Jogja,Shradhaa JR,5,Good international menu. Vegan and vegetarian options available (this was a huge bonus for me since finding vegetarian food in Indonesia is a challenge). Lovely ambience and service. Would definitely recommend a visit.

I came back with my husband for dinner and their food is so bad, my prawn laksa was no taste at all and a bit rotten. Their beras kencur jamu also taste weird.. my husband had his stroganoff and it was okay. Just okay. I read some of the reviews before we went there and I have to say that most of their bad reviews are correct. The restaurant was empty. That's explained a lot since I remember via via was always full. Please owner, do something about this, read all the reviews and maybe you can do something about it.

2936,ChIJzfDAL5JXei4RB_2bokRgwJ0,Water Castle Cafe,Felita Wijaya,5,Love the foods and drinks. For the food I ordered Mie Goreng Campur. It's very unique because the fried noodle mixed vegetables and with fruits. Weird? NO! It's delicious. The owner always chooses the best and fresh fruits. About the drink I ordered Mango Lassy. No sugar added. The sweetness is from the fruit mixed with yogurt. So yummy and creamy. All balance. Love love love. Very recommended!

At the water castle, you find the Water Castle cafe.
A true old Warung. It's small and full of art. The warm welcome and interesting drawings on the wall and ceiling will keep you busy for a¬†while. They serve¬†fresh juices and make very tasty pancakes (with fruit). Please use the extra 'stroop'!

I'm happy to recommend these very friendly people in a historical place.

Please note: It's hard to reach by car, as it's in the middle of the market (pasar). And walking around this pasar is already a fun experience. It's quiet and peaceful."
2940,ChIJ0wSfOJZXei4RLXsSo0E7C7Y,Sixsenses Kitchen,Hui Fen Chua,3,"Cod fish fritters are a scam. There‚Äôs more flour than cod fish and so expensive still. Duck confit was pretty good and I love the roasted potatoes that comes with it. It‚Äôs like one of the best potatoes I‚Äôve eaten.

Have feedback to the staff about the cod fish fritters. Hopefully there‚Äôs gonna be some change for future diners.

Staff service is pretty decent. Food pricing is on the steep side. I would rather go to another restaurant around the corner for their European food."
2941,ChIJ0wSfOJZXei4RLXsSo0E7C7Y,Sixsenses Kitchen,Adi Kurniawan,5,"There are no many options for decent restaurants in town but this one is worth trying.

A glass of local red wine (from Bali) was only IDR 50.000 (5aud), it wasn‚Äôt bad at all! Yes, they do have beers, lovely!

It‚Äôs a very interesting building and design. More tourists come here for dinner while there are also some locals.
The waitress have a good basic English, so communication was no problem.

Visa and Mastercard are accepted, which we prefer to pay by visa and no additional charge needed.

The food was excellent! I didn‚Äôt expect to have a good food in this city but I can strongly say that I was very satisfied. I ordered tenderloin steak with medium cooked and it was perfectly prepared as I expected üëåüèº

2943,ChIJ0wSfOJZXei4RLXsSo0E7C7Y,Sixsenses Kitchen,Agus PD,5,"An excellent restaurant for  family occasions and entertaining business partners. It's located in a colonial mansion, and a recent addition of a huge pendopo (traditional Javanese Hall). The foods served are mostly of Spanish and European origin. The prices are actually moderate for the high quality ingredients. Overall, properly cooked and presented in a nice ambiance. This resto serves alcohol so they have a full pledge bar. There's a live music in the evenings."

I'm not sure why but the service was quite upsetting since in my opinion, they aren't fast enough to notice what the customers needs like refilling water or offer us something.

2947,ChIJH03CYY1Xei4RTDTe65njvUk,Bale Raos - The Sultan's Dishes,Ardo Sanjaya,5,"A very nice place with great food, although its more similar to a fine dining place instead of ordinary restaurants. All of the food are good but the Duck and the Ox Tongue definitely steal the spotlight. The Beer Jawa is also a must try (non-alcoholic)"
2948,ChIJH03CYY1Xei4RTDTe65njvUk,Bale Raos - The Sultan's Dishes,Inda Risinda,4,Actually this place is good as a place but for food I think not as what I expected.. I was here with the tour group and they only served you like 5 menu.. the taste were okay but I guess it could be better.. maybe the travel agents who was not really good arranging the food.. so I think I should visit here again by my own one day.. nevertheless it's a good resto..
2949,ChIJH03CYY1Xei4RTDTe65njvUk,Bale Raos - The Sultan's Dishes,By Yui,3,"Lil bit pricey n I'm more into modern minimalistic design so the place kinda nah but they have friendly staff, the foods traditional of course n taste good for some of them, there are some appetizers and dessert that rare to see. You shouldn't take motorcycle inside so you need to turn off ur engine because it's keraton/palace area."
2950,ChIJ3UKwraJZei4RtKdyX9Km-Jk,De Celine Restaurant,Chrysan Lim,5,"This is our detour. Did hv any plan to visit this place, we only saw it on our way to our hotel. So we stop by for our dinner. Ordered Chicken Aglio Olio, Zuppa Soup, Super Supreme Pizza & Woku Fried Rice. All taste realy nice, tbh beyond our expectation. Would be lovely if the food served still warm enough, coz when the food is served the temp is abit room temp."

Need more training for all the staff to represent good place and good food at the same time

For a photoshoot, this is a place üëå
For family dinner, not recommended at all"

2953,ChIJ3UKwraJZei4RtKdyX9Km-Jk,De Celine Restaurant,Jo Holder,1,"Terrible service. We were waiting for the food for at least 20 min and when eventually I got my meal my husband was still waiting for his .The waiter brought 2 dishes but gave one to another person who was not here yet when we ordered our meals.Because it was the same order we guessed my husband‚Äôs meal was given away so he had to wait another 20 mins and could not get any attention from waiters who were just not interested ., My rice was cold , egg tough and satay tiny. Eventually the manager acknowledged the situation and we got an apology with complementary cake and jelly but the experience was already spoiled.We won‚Äôt be returning."
2954,ChIJ3UKwraJZei4RtKdyX9Km-Jk,De Celine Restaurant,Imanuel Alberto,3,"Good concept resto, located adjacent to House of Raminten. Food taste are average or even below average. Since it is newly opened, the staff look inexperienced at all: wrong table delivery, wrong menu and so on... Need improvements to retain customers"
2955,ChIJjVVCAuNXei4RJPdRTyZCyLM,Landhuis Resto,kame kuro,4,"the place is small but sweet with a touch of old times interior when it was still in the early days of independence. the food served seems to be different every day. this place serves food that is identical to home cooking. it tastes good, doesn't feel too much msg. friendly service.

what's a bit troublesome is that the place is hidden in the gas station area, and not visible from the highway. the car park is not wide enough. not friendly for the disabled.

plus points, the place is clean, there is a sink at the entrance. the atmosphere is calm"
2956,ChIJjVVCAuNXei4RJPdRTyZCyLM,Landhuis Resto,Anna,5,"Spent 2.5 hours sitting at their outdoor area with an old friend along with their tasty yet affordable Indonesia menu. Quite surprised that she found this place which a bit hidden from the main street. Few tips: go straight to the gas station to spot this resto. Love their old furnitures and classic interior design, good ambiance and great services."
2957,ChIJjVVCAuNXei4RJPdRTyZCyLM,Landhuis Resto,Banyu Sadewa,5,"Literally one of THE HIDDEN GEM in Jogja. Located behind SPBU Tomohon, this place is quite difficult to find if you didn‚Äôt see the sign. Once you enter this place it feels like you enter a Time Machine. You gonna feel like you throwback to a 19th Century. They served a lot variety of Indonesian food. The food taste is literally like a homecook food, cooked by your own Grandma. And of course IT‚ÄôS SO DELICIOUS! Not to mention they are so cheap! You SHOULD come to this place, feel the vibe and taste the food and you‚Äôll never regret."
2958,ChIJjVVCAuNXei4RJPdRTyZCyLM,Landhuis Resto,Imam Rustadi,5,"Clasical restaurant with local food.
Not so much option for food, but the place is verry nice.

2961,ChIJ16Eg6c9Zei4R2QBTw2PDzJY,Rumah Makan Ajam Goreng Lombok Idjo,Melissa Fu,5,"What is the most thing that I miss from this restaurant? The sour vegetable (sayur asem). And of course, the fried chicken is delicious too. They use kampung chicken. The taste of the fried chicken is suit for me. I suggest you to sit in the edge side to feel the water fan atmosphere üòÇ."
2962,ChIJ16Eg6c9Zei4R2QBTw2PDzJY,Rumah Makan Ajam Goreng Lombok Idjo,Susanto Yudi,5,"Great restaurants for family and kids, also the taste of the foods is really great. Gurame bakar madu and sayur asem is the best for me"
2963,ChIJ16Eg6c9Zei4R2QBTw2PDzJY,Rumah Makan Ajam Goreng Lombok Idjo,Asmaul Husna,5,Traditional food with good serving. Unfortunalety for toilets still mix (woman n man) and not clean.
2964,ChIJ16Eg6c9Zei4R2QBTw2PDzJY,Rumah Makan Ajam Goreng Lombok Idjo,Muhammad Zaki Afif,1,"First and last time I dined here. We ordered what they said were their best food (gurameh and chicken) and honestly the whole thing was disappointing. The fish tasted raw and I can't help but feel it was underseasoned. What an experience!

For its price, honestly it wasn't worth it. There are tons of better, more reliable resto and dines with cheaper the price.

The 1 star was for the place, it looked decent."
2965,ChIJI_Wmq3FZei4R7SYDsvUHPAM,Kalluna,F Paul,4,"Just like many popular cafes in Indonesia, the strong point of this place is Instagram-able place and food. They are pretty and nice in pic, and probably a good place to bring your date.

Flavour wise, the food is average. It's enjoyable but not super special."
2966,ChIJI_Wmq3FZei4R7SYDsvUHPAM,Kalluna,Johaness Castle (703),5,"The place: it's great, comfortable and the atmosphere is pleasant enough for the customer who come.

The service: is good enough for Me, just need more charm, smile, and a bit faster response to the customers whose about to make some orders.

The food is very good for Me (whether for the presentation and the taste). Just need a bit of improvisation at the fire temperature and more love (for every dish which is served with love will always work for the customers.

Overall, this place is worth of visit to enjoy the food and hanging out with family and friends. Absolutely recommended, love it!"
2967,ChIJI_Wmq3FZei4R7SYDsvUHPAM,Kalluna,Winston Arethe Mulyadi,3,"Entrance look small. Only limited parking space for cars. But inside is spacious enough. Only indoor seating area. They have second floor but not sure what is it.
Ordered spaghetti but it is too salty. Beverages are ok."
2968,ChIJI_Wmq3FZei4R7SYDsvUHPAM,Kalluna,Liya Mandra Lestari,5,"Just looking from the outside design to the interior design, already giving you very relaxing and nice vibe to have good meals.

I ordered curry butter chicken and the taste was very light and suitable with my taste.

Really live the place and the food. Will definitely come back when I visit Yogya again.."
2969,ChIJI_Wmq3FZei4R7SYDsvUHPAM,Kalluna,Meisya Putri,5,"Nice place, clean, good ambiance, and delicious food! I ordered chicken chop with mashed potato and mushroom sauce. I love the juicy and well seasoned chicken."
2970,ChIJA0YH5DFYei4RA8aRjoBXkb8,The House of Raminten,Yuri van den Brand,5,"Good authentic food!

Be sure to either make a reservation or wait for a bit to be seated: this place is very popular.
Luckily there is a good queue-system (you wait in the waiting-area until a table is available for you).

Don't hesitate to ask the waiters fot recommendations on which food is good. Most dishes do not have (English) descriptions next to them so for most of the dishes you have to look at the picture to know what is in there."
2971,ChIJA0YH5DFYei4RA8aRjoBXkb8,The House of Raminten,Charmaine V,5,"Unique Indonesia dining experience with the  service and atmosphere.

Food is definitely made to order, served hot with tradational flavour and awesome variety.

The jumbo drink can go around for a party of 4 plus people.

Enjoyed our visit."
2972,ChIJA0YH5DFYei4RA8aRjoBXkb8,The House of Raminten,dzulfiqar Amien,4,"A worthy restaurant to visit in Yogyakarta. You must make a reservation with the waiter to determine an available table. Because during the day, conditions are crowded and many seats are not available. The atmosphere along with the Javanese food here has its own characteristics for this place. The restaurant's waiter served in a friendly and helpful manner with some of the jokes he made. The air in some places feels hot but there are many fans available to keep the air cool."
2973,ChIJA0YH5DFYei4RA8aRjoBXkb8,The House of Raminten,bastil,4,"The place was very busy when we went there early Tuesday evening. But it didn't take long until we were ushered in to our seats. The food we ordered were delicious and nicely prepared. The price was also very reasonable. Moreover, the waitress that attended us was very friendly and helpful. I liked that staff wore traditional Javanese attire.
How it could have been better:
The music was too loud for my liking. To my consternation the restaurant only accepted cash. Overall, it is a place worth visiting when you are in Jogjakarta."
2974,ChIJA0YH5DFYei4RA8aRjoBXkb8,The House of Raminten,andy aryawan,3,"An appreciation for their various menu of traditional food. Even the taste is nothing special for me. Service and hospitality is good,notes for their interior layout. Its quite hot since their air circulation is insufficient in my opinion"
2975,ChIJ3SIrLCZYei4RZ90lt_KQRfw,Sate Ayam Podomoro,Hasnadhiazahra Rohadi,5,"Great sate in the town they use ayam kampung for the sate, and it is one of the legendary sate resto in jogja üëçüëç"
2976,ChIJ3SIrLCZYei4RZ90lt_KQRfw,Sate Ayam Podomoro,Bayu Agung,4,"I ordered 10 satay, 2 rice cakes (lontong) and 1 bottle of mineral water, it costs me 35 thousand rupiah. The chicken satay tasted ordinary, quite hard to chew. I can find a lot cheaper and better satay stall in Jakarta."
2977,ChIJ3SIrLCZYei4RZ90lt_KQRfw,Sate Ayam Podomoro,Thyas Pramesthi,5,"Yes, I think, this is the best satay I ever try! Even in Yogya, the peanut sauce is very tasty compare to others.

No wonder that this satay is very delicious, because it's been selling the chicken satay since 1959.

This place is located not far from the Yogya train station, can be reach 5 minutes by car. The palce is easily seen from the road. The place still keep the original style of an old javanese house, it's not persuaded by the new era.

I bought a portion of chicken satay, ate with steamed rice covered in banana leaves and drank warm black tea without sugar.

I recognized that the waiters is an old man, and the drinking man is also an old man. I was wondering, do they serve in this satay place for years?

Okay then I will revisit this place when I come to Yogya again."
2978,ChIJ3SIrLCZYei4RZ90lt_KQRfw,Sate Ayam Podomoro,The Pawrents,4,"So far this is the best chicken satay in town. The satay tasted delicious, no wonder coz this is the oldest chicken satay shop in Yogyakarta. Abit pricey but worth the taste. Most of customers are old peoples and family. Poor, the shop don't have proper parking area."
2979,ChIJ3SIrLCZYei4RZ90lt_KQRfw,Sate Ayam Podomoro,Maya MSD,5,"My favorite chicken satay. The peanut seasoning is very authentic üëå

2980,ChIJw66vIxpXei4R7LAhCem3l2U,Omah Dhuwur Restaurant,Richard Wu,4,"We followed our principle that when we are not sure, always ask the locals. The answers are presented by simply asking.

This is recommended by the locals with good design and good food. We are really happy that we got to come to this place. Quiet and good food.

The service is, again, central Javanese soft spoken and tender care. We really enjoyed it. The food is not much different from other parts of Indonesia according to my expat tongue. But it is good and you can choose sweet or spicy ones.

This was the last stop before we left and we had a good ending here. You should also give it a try when you can. This place is unlike others, it is simply good."
2981,ChIJw66vIxpXei4R7LAhCem3l2U,Omah Dhuwur Restaurant,Charmaine V,4,"Open green space, but limited menu choice.

The Tiramisu cup and Oreo Cup were really good. Basic fried cassava, Soursop juice were well done.

Staff were friendly."
2982,ChIJw66vIxpXei4R7LAhCem3l2U,Omah Dhuwur Restaurant,Dorito,5,"Good food and nice place even if a bit more expensive. You can find some some cheaper options on the menu too.

We were mainly here to do a small batik workshop. There's a very friendly lady who makes batik here. You can make a handkerchief, small bag, totebag or mask with her. It was a lot of fun, a good price and she was such a sweet soul. Terima kasih Mbak Botini üôè"
2983,ChIJw66vIxpXei4R7LAhCem3l2U,Omah Dhuwur Restaurant,Raden Oktova Gamma Star,4,"An exclusive restaurant at Kota Gede, Yogyakarta offering traditional as well as popular foods and beverages. I have come here twice with my students and colleagues last year. We have tried, among others, oxtail soup, fried Javanese noodle, karedok (mixed boiled vegetables with sweet spicy peanut sauce), serai (lemongrass) drink, and fried rice. The foods and beverages were delicious but not extraordinary. A clean, spacious place with a beautiful traditional Javanese (joglo) architecture and large tables. Clean toilets and a good musholla (moslem prayer place) with a facility for taking a wash before the prayer (wudlu). Expensive. Needs more selfie picture spots for young people."
2984,ChIJw66vIxpXei4R7LAhCem3l2U,Omah Dhuwur Restaurant,J Raditya,5,"The restaurant housed in a historic building. They has various menu of Indonesian cuisine, with Asian and Western as well.

2990,ChIJL1l6rDtYei4R4eHSCyb3dLo,Lupis Mbah Satinem,Florentina Nathania,5,"Waited 1.5 hours for my order and it was quite worth it. I tried at least 4 different kinds of rice cakes and tiwul. I could say they were all home made, the palm sugar was not too sweet. You might want to get there very early, at least 5.30 am so you don't wait very long."
2991,ChIJL1l6rDtYei4R4eHSCyb3dLo,Lupis Mbah Satinem,Diantoro Deka Saputra,5,"Lopis was good. The ratio between price and portion was not good, the portion too small with that price. The seller is mbah (grandmother) who still sell this lopis for years until now. The queue to get this Lopis was amazing, you need to get your number before 6 in the morning to get early."
2992,ChIJL1l6rDtYei4R4eHSCyb3dLo,Lupis Mbah Satinem,Luqman Hakim,4,"Traditional cuisine with old recipes, the taste is soo unique, combined stinky rice, plam sugar, cassava rice topping with shredded coconut meat.
So people come not for the food but the show, how mix the food.
Please remember the queues is sooo long, in peak holiday season you need to wait 1-2 hours to be served. You can come at 5.30 to get queue numbers.

price is quite reasonable. queue is super long, especially on the weekends. but good thing that they have a numbering system, so first come first served.

she sells a few kinds of sweets, but my fav is the Lupis. portion is enough for breakfast."

The place is great with separate playground so the kids won‚Äôt disturb other customers and the food was ok... the price in the other hand is shocking. So we only order very limited meals.
If you have kids this place is worth to visit"

Tuna baked rice was ok.
Hot chocolate ws delicious.
Red velvet latte was average.
Kunena garden salad with italian dressing was not my taste."

The restaurant is spacious but lacking the warmth and coziness. Very ordinary and bland.

3031,ChIJd2gEmcJZei4RdVMllasBH1s,BALCONY Kitchen & Pastry,Lilo,5,"Super good, I've always get the steaks here. Definitely one of the best steaks in Yogyakarta, even though this place is not specifically a steak house. Such a shame that they do not sell wagyu steak anymore. Other than the steaks almost everything I've tried on the menu is good. A good place to splurge once in a while. Definitely would recommend it to my friends."

Service was excellent, Staffs were very polite and the place was clean! I came back for my favorite Balcony Fried Rice too. The taste was amazing and had lots of different amazing Nusantara taste inside it. Peanut Sauce Sate and the Fried Rice Thick Soy Sauce flavor were amazing.

I encourage everyone to give it a try! They have lots of other different Asian & Western menu too."

3035,ChIJq-iuDzlYei4RnGezBGtCV-A,R&B Grill,Yuri Alessandro,5,"Great steak house in Yogyakarta.
We are seated in their new buildings with private & comfy private room.

Nice & experienced waitress. The room is equipped with air conditioners.

Great choices of steaks from Wagyu, US, Australian, Japanese & dry aged.

9/10 dining experience for me.

I wish they have better & more delicate wine choices.
Most importantly the right wine glass.
(We are offered water glass - similiar like red wine glass, but very small)"

Overall I will give 8/10.
The food is good, the portion is big enough for me, I almost can't finish my meal. The price is also good. They over different kind of food, and meat, so you can chose your favorite one!

The service is good, but they include service tax then add it to your buying cost then giving food tax for it, a lil bit annoy me due to the calculation. Haha"
3038,ChIJq-iuDzlYei4RnGezBGtCV-A,R&B Grill,Ayi,4,"The place is nicely decorated and comfortable if you want to hang out w your friends or family. The choices in the menu are various. The service is quick and friendly. There is a mini market just in front of the restaurant, so it's convenient: you can do some grocery shopping just after lunch. They have another building not far from the old one."
3039,ChIJq-iuDzlYei4RnGezBGtCV-A,R&B Grill,Virna AR,5,"Since we were here for brunch, we ordered Thai beef salad and Caesar Salad, the Thai beef is so spicy but very delicious and nicely presented in a bowl, generous portion of  caesar salad, lil bit pricey but worth it. they share a meat shop, bakery, and sell imported goods. Car parking area available, fast service, outdoor and indoor dining area. Next we will try the steaks!"

they have bunch of package menus that can be iur option to save more money but extra dish hahaha.

since I was eat at this restaurant couple years ago, I really love the casava's leave and Sayur Asem until now. The sambals tasted good. Tempe & Tahu are also good, everything is good I think. This Restaurant truly represent the javanese and sundanese cuisine.

Suprisingly I first time order the fish soup, I forgot the name. It was really good,"

3052,ChIJi5QBU7pZei4RfxLHtCadUSQ,Maximilian Private Dining,Tietha Birgitta,5,"During this pandemic, they serve private dining. I think it's a really good idea, and you're served really good. The appetizer is my favorite: pretzel!! The main course I took rib eye with brown sauce which was awesome.  The only menu, I didn't really enjoy, is the dessert. It is really sweet. But for the sweet tooth I believe it will be just fine. It's a villa too so basically you will enjoy the villa's atmosphere, with the pool and garden. But, the reservation for private dining took a long steps, which actually can be simplified."

Great bratwurst. Live music needs major improvement, though. Very kind and attentive staff. Cream chicken soup was superb. Price was reasonable. Parking lot too small for 3 cars. They also serve potato, buttered rice, vegetables. Thank you Maximilian for giving us great evening!"
3055,ChIJi5QBU7pZei4RfxLHtCadUSQ,Maximilian Private Dining,Ron Piltzer,3,"Very nice venue.
Nothing remarkable about the food.  This agreed by all six in our party.  Bland and served cold.
We were the only guests, but delivery of food extremely slow.
Why my spatzel was served before appetizers was puzzling.
Service waiter did his best.
Improvements are necessary."

3058,ChIJnfidqqNXei4R4ZUUUD-bA7s,Easy Garden Restaurant & Cafe,Anthony James,4,"This place is quite a nice spot. It was decent prices for what we ordered. I had pizza and fries, my partner had spring rolls and an Indonesian dish (forgot the name). The alcohol wasn‚Äôt overpriced here considering where we are, food was a good enough quality and the place has a nice setting. Only let down was there wasn‚Äôt any background sound, no music on or anything, and the garlic on my pizza wasn‚Äôt in the for form of an oil/paste or confit like you‚Äôd normally get, but it was whole chunks of raw garlic. The pizza was nice but I had to pick them off. I‚Äôd recommend the place to those visiting, thanks Easy Garden."
3059,ChIJnfidqqNXei4R4ZUUUD-bA7s,Easy Garden Restaurant & Cafe,Geanni Tityan,5,"You should put this place to the list of dinner destination/bar in Prawirotaman/Suryadiningratan street.

3062,ChIJRXwEKYhXei4Rn3SxsVMvRj0,Mahkota Chinese Restaurant,Udaya Manggala,4,"Their most famous dish is the ""Mie Kakap"", a noodle made from fish. It was good, but i love their Pu Yung Hai better - it is just a classic dish, all time favourite. I could be bias here.

Not many parking spots, so do come early."
3063,ChIJRXwEKYhXei4Rn3SxsVMvRj0,Mahkota Chinese Restaurant,Arthur Jonathan,4,"Was hesitant at first because the restaurant looked like it was abandoned lol!
No one was eating there and everything looked so old.

The staff could‚Äôve been better. He asked me my order like 5 times (it was 2 dishes) and still got my drink order wrong.

But the food surprised me. It was excellent, the Bistik Ayam was so good. The Fried Noodles too! Just what you would expect from a traditional chinese restaurant."
3064,ChIJRXwEKYhXei4Rn3SxsVMvRj0,Mahkota Chinese Restaurant,Irindhita Laras Putri,5,A legend. And one of the most delicious Chinese restaurant in town. They have pork menu. Bit pricey for local customers but their foods are worth to try.
3065,ChIJRXwEKYhXei4Rn3SxsVMvRj0,Mahkota Chinese Restaurant,Mikro Global,4,"Good chinese food..
Only difficult to park the car"
3066,ChIJRXwEKYhXei4Rn3SxsVMvRj0,Mahkota Chinese Restaurant,Marcel Kumontoy,2,"It is a disappointing experience for out-of-towners such as us that made efforts to come to the restaurant hoping to be able to taste the famous signature ""snapper noodle"" but unable because they don't have continuing stock at the time we arrive for lunch (at 12:30ish). They only do production once a week an when they're gone, they're gone....so don't keep your hopes too high.
So we tried ordering fried breaded snapper. But also no stock.
In much disappointment, we ordered pork satay, pork steak, sauteed broccoli with garlic and fried rice with ham (take-out). Pork dishes were a bit tough to chew but the ham fried rice was great.
So if you hoped to try the signature dish, my advice is to call in advance to check the availability to avoid disappointment such as mine."
3067,ChIJQS8_ytJZei4RK9-6ZrnGGOI,Baru Restaurant,Irindhita Laras Putri,5,"An old fashioned Chinese restaurant, and one of the best in town from those era. Non-halal restaurant because they sell pork. My most favorite menu is the very simple and original: Ayam Goreng Mentega. Because they put flour for a tasty crispy coating and makes the chicken sooo juicy inside."
3068,ChIJQS8_ytJZei4RK9-6ZrnGGOI,Baru Restaurant,Sugianto Hendrata,5,"Old style chinese cuisine, good taste, afordable price, a view car park, fast service even at busy time."
3069,ChIJQS8_ytJZei4RK9-6ZrnGGOI,Baru Restaurant,Firman Adi Prayogo,5,One of legend for Chinese Restaurant at Yogyakarta. Just order Nasi Goreng Istimewa and Sla as I came alone. Taste is light and I don't think they use MSG a lot. You may visit if you love old ambience.
3070,ChIJQS8_ytJZei4RK9-6ZrnGGOI,Baru Restaurant,jaya lim,4,"Old fashioned javanese chinese food resto. The food is as you expected as the one from your grandma kitchen. Simple, warm and yummy. Crowded most of the time and please be patient while they prepared your order."

3072,ChIJqTiMBZtXei4R8F1oLGB-Wa0,Gazebo Garden Restaurant,a b,5,"Went here prior to the Ramayana ballet, and it is actually in the same complex. This ballet was lovely. Beautiful performance of classical Javanese costume and dancing telling the iconic Ramayana story. Performed with live classical music. Agree with other reviews to read about the story prior to the show to help understand. Some scenes are not explained in their provided summary and are usually showing the characters asking gods for help to win the battle with offerings, but these characters are not introduced at the beginning so it can be confusing. We went during the rainy season, when the Prambanam ballet is inside anyways. This is actually more of a covered awning theater than truly indoors, but clean and cool with fans. You can take photos with the main characters at the end of the show. The dinner buffet was a great sample of classical Javanese and Indonesian food, not too spicy at baseline but lots of sauces to add spice to your preference. Live traditional music and even dancing during the dinner, very attentive and polite staff. Highly recommend the whole experience!!"
3073,ChIJqTiMBZtXei4R8F1oLGB-Wa0,Gazebo Garden Restaurant,Koen,5,"Located on a beautiful courtyard, this restaurant offers a well-kept dinner show. The delicious food from the extensive buffet (there is almost too much choice) is livened up with traditional Javanese music, singing and a taste of the dance show. Friendly and fast service make the visit a very pleasant experience."

The place is comfortable and quite crowded, which is right in the middle of Yogyakarta city. Impressed with a comfortable place with family and not a place to hang out for a long time

The menu is quite tasty and interesting appliqu√©s, friendly and super helpful service from the staff.  In terms of price, it's worth it with the location and the best view of the monument

They have reasonable price for their foods, beverages and place. I ordered the cream meat lover, hazelnut coffee, fried banana, rawon, and nasi bakar, and lychee tea: all of them tasted good. Unfortunately, their lychee mojito doesnt taste good, its all just sweet and doesnt taste like they pour soda into it. but all in all, things are quite good."

I was focusing on some plates while throwing back time to my childhood life as my family took me here ever since so long around 20 years ago.

3097,ChIJNzwAZV1Xei4RVTp_xIzuC2I,Restaurant Warung Toscana,Anne Dewanto,5,"Was craving yummy comfortable decent pasta for the night and saw Warung Toscana right across the street from the alley street from my hotel. All of the pasta seems tempting yet I need some beef to fill my tummy, so I got the tortellini beef with creamy mushroom sauce accompanied by a glass of hot ginger tea.

The food was good although the temperature between the pasta and the sauce was somewhat different, might be processed on different plates beforehand? Not sure but it wasn't really an issue but it felt funny a little bit on my tongue. The sauce could get creamier and less salty, perhaps for a better flavor perception.

The place was comfortable and the staffs were friendly. Overall, great experience trying out Italian food in Yogyakarta :) might want to take another visit soon once I go back here to try the other menu !!"
3098,ChIJNzwAZV1Xei4RVTp_xIzuC2I,Restaurant Warung Toscana,Anthony Huszar,5,"Very friendly and the food tasted good. Tried the Reenee salad. Not much info provided in the menu but it was tasty and essentially a good portion of mixed fresh salad vegetables (in case that's what you're missing). The soto betawar was also good, and the pizza tasted fresh."
3099,ChIJNzwAZV1Xei4RVTp_xIzuC2I,Restaurant Warung Toscana,Mafalda Pereira,5,"The food was very good for an Italian place in Indonesia. Tiramisu was specially good!

The service is excellent. Staff are friendly and helpful. Ambience is pretty good too, we went on Friday night, so not too many people in the restaurant, we can enjoy some peaceful dinner time.

The food is ordinary, to be honest. The grill is pretty good, you can choose the meat you want, and they grill it for you. The choices are mini steak, chicken, fish, some sausages. However, the other food is quite ordinary and limited choices, they have Soto Banjar, Mie Jawa, Semur Daging, Bakwan Jagung, Pempek Palembang.. For the dessert, they have some cakes, and some traditional Indonesian cakes, like lapis, kue putu and wajik."
3107,ChIJA44kG45Zei4RTcxGNFlvJA4,Dimsum Sembilan Naga - Jogja,Gisella Dirtya,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this place. The interior was tastefully decorated with traditional elements, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The menu there offered a wide range of Chinese delicacies, making it difficult to choose just a few dishes. After careful consideration, my companions and I decided to start with some steam foods, soup and steam rice. All foods are satisfying and worth to try."
3108,ChIJA44kG45Zei4RTcxGNFlvJA4,Dimsum Sembilan Naga - Jogja,Krido Sadmoko,4,"A dim sum restaurant chain from Bandung finally arrived at this city. Their hakau, siomay, babi goreng krispi, bubur, bakpau, mantau, you name it, all is delicious.
They mark the halal and non halal on the menu list, so it can easily spotted.
Their dining area is clean and the parking lot is spacious enough.
The price? Reasonable!
Wanna try? Just do it."
3109,ChIJA44kG45Zei4RTcxGNFlvJA4,Dimsum Sembilan Naga - Jogja,Dennis Mitchel,5,"Food is amazing, anything with pork is a must try. But one of their most hidden gem are the Chili oil and the juicy dimsum. Must try is the egg yolk baos, very creamy, thick and authentic bao.
Atmosphere is very old school chinese restaurant. Lots of fan inside, even when the temperature outside is so hot, you won't feel the heat inside."
3110,ChIJA44kG45Zei4RTcxGNFlvJA4,Dimsum Sembilan Naga - Jogja,Puraditya B S,5,Good dimsum / dumpling & chinese food restaurant at Yogyakarta. Recommended for breakfast / lunch / dinner. Price little bit expensive but it is worth it. The porridge and noodle is standard which is good. However the dumpling / dimsum is great and very delicious. The room ambiance setup same as hongkong / chinese style coffee shop. Ok for family or bring small children / kids. Park area limited but enough for 10 cars and 20 motorcycle.
3111,ChIJA44kG45Zei4RTcxGNFlvJA4,Dimsum Sembilan Naga - Jogja,Zefa Dhia,5,"The taste are so good for local Dimsum!! It has 11/12 diffrent taste with Wing-Heng.. especially for the sauce because it's less sweet for me... But the service are super good, they are so friendly, and will change the food if we feel not good... So it will be my favorite Dimsum place!!"

3113,ChIJEQdUqwpXei4RmunE45rgf60,BS Resto,Mariani Sutanto,5,"Makjang's coffee, delicious! What's more, the metozt package, complete with everything: garlic bread+egg+milk coffee. The combination of eggs and bread, this is the jossest breakfast, closed with the breakfast celebration by sipping warm coffee that makes the eyes fresh.

The second half of breakfast: gandul rice. I've never eaten gandul rice, but once I tried it here, it's delicious! The gravy is thick and the pieces of meat are tender. There is a slight sweet taste, which reminds me that this is Yogya.

The location of this shop is right next to Borobudur Silver, part of BS Resto, specifically serving a simple but nutritious breakfast.

A breakfast that makes you happy, if you're full, that's for sure! Moreover, the price is friendly, pan

3114,ChIJEQdUqwpXei4RmunE45rgf60,BS Resto,Adrian Purwadinata,5,"It hasn't been a month yet but the authenticity of the food is undeniable. Among the choices of food on offer, it seems appropriate to eat soto and rice gandul in the morning, and to accompany our long chat... proceed to toast bread.
Comes with wedang uwuh and hot tea.. so perfect, friend.
.
.
The portion is just right for the chicken soup and the gandul rice.. with the right spices, very delicious with tempeh and crackers as side dishes.
Nasi gandul is a typical dish from Pati, Central Java. At first glance, it might look like curry sauce or like Nganjuk's muddy rice.
.
.
The toast bread is also different from other toast breads.. with soft chocolate filling combined with soft bread too.. especially the uwuh wedang sruput bro.. yumm..
.
.
Its name is Kedai BS, on the street of minister supeno, friend.. right next to @borobudursilver. Open every day from 6.00 to 14.00 if you haven't run out yet, friend.. worth a try. I don't want anymore

The restaurant is uniquely designed and the owner is super friendly. The dishes are beautifully plated and they're delish. You
have to make a reservation in advance. Very recommended (I paid a visit a while ago but forgot to leave a review üòÅ)"
3118,ChIJwcsJHPZXei4R4kF5_cBWais,The Tannoor Restaurant,Ade Sanjaya,5,"I had a great dining experience here. A good friend of mine recommended this restaurant to me and brought me here.

3119,ChIJwcsJHPZXei4R4kF5_cBWais,The Tannoor Restaurant,Tretya A,5,"We have to make a reservation before dining here. I am not foreign to Middle Eastern or Indian food but this was my first experience to Afghan food. I was told by the host that the cuisine was more influenced by Turkey (if I'm not mistaken).

We ordered 3 dishes for two, chicken tikka, dopiazza and mantu. The tikka was a bit on the saltier side to my taste (this is only personal preference), still,  everything was great. The meat was tender. I used to see mantu (dumpling) closely attached as a part of Chinese dishes but dining here gave me a new perspective about other food cultures.

Prices are on the average, around Rp 150k (including the tax) for 3 dishes that we ordered. Definitely worth every penny. The restaurant is a little tucked away, might be a bit tricky for a first timer."
3120,ChIJwcsJHPZXei4R4kF5_cBWais,The Tannoor Restaurant,Nanda,5,"My favorites? Mantu (dumplings with yoghurt), Boynjan Broyani (the vegetarian option of grilled eggplant)

But really, the rest of the menu is all yummy.

drinks? chai tea! and mango doogh.

Loving the meals and thr fact that there is these meal in Jogja. Will be a regular for sure!

You may get lost a bit as there is no sign. But look for a house with no door and just enter.

Book at least a day in advance. I promise you, it's worth it!"

They served authentic chinesse dishes with large portion, worth the price. Every dishes can be shared by two or three people.
We had tjap jae goreng (stirred veggies with various meat) and koloke (deep fried sliced chicken coated in flour, served with sweet and sour souce).
For sure a gem between the sweets and savoury of Jogjakarta, for sure we will visit again
See you Jogjakarta üòÄ"

Why Chef Mima? The duck is soft, tasty, not fishy, ‚Äã‚Äãthe spices are perfectly absorbed, don't ask for the sambal.

How does it compare to the duck next door which has many branches?
The sauce is the same, only the duck at Chef Mima isn't dry, it's juicy.

So just taste, if you don't like duck that is too dry, chef Mima is your choice. Guaranteed to collect.

During the fasting month, free takjil aqua and dates are provided.

Unfortunately I ordered their level four hot chili. And it was super duper hot. Never order their level three and above because it was extremely hot. You can't really taste the original flavor since it's too spicy. I will come again to taste their other menus. Highly recommended!

They have 2 work stations, one for the meal and another one is for the drink. They also have a sitting area upstairs where you can feel fresh air.

What they offer here is traditional food. The plating looks good and so does the taste. Went here last night with a friend and it was satisfying. We love the food, especially urap and tempe mendoan. Their wedang jahe is also nice. The owner is friendly, he patiently explained and described what we asked about the food on the list."

3193,ChIJcWPbYTBYei4R5__kiNVcX6Y,Madam Tan Indonesian Food,Sud J,4,Visiting again as the food was so great last time....but now I think the place has lost its charm! The food was average this time but the ambiance is good!!!

Excellent service with attention to small details to make a customer's visit very satisfying.

Their recommendations are a must try meat platter for 1 person has a good potion of meat and deserve a mention.

Tried the kebabs, buns were super soft and their twist on eggplant will stun you.

A chilled out ambiance with an engaging PR and special mention to a very friendly owner Lucia. Thank you for making our dinner very memorable."

Thank you üî•"
3199,ChIJu46AxyZYei4RuIq-5pavcfA,Makmur Restaurant,Thin Thin,5,"Dear Owners, I am really grateful that your restaurant existed just nearby my hostel. I was really sick of ‚Äúfried‚Äù foods after just 3 days in Yogyakarta and your simple and savoury dishes make me feel like ‚Äúhome‚Äù. I wish you will have more customers because you really deserve to earn more.
Indeed, a very good and affordable Chinese cuisine out here."
3200,ChIJu46AxyZYei4RuIq-5pavcfA,Makmur Restaurant,s v,5,The food here is excellent and so is the service. Highly recommend
3201,ChIJu46AxyZYei4RuIq-5pavcfA,Makmur Restaurant,Andrian Hendrawan,4,Good traditional chinese taste. Too bad nasi campur was too plain but the portion was quite generous
3202,ChIJu46AxyZYei4RuIq-5pavcfA,Makmur Restaurant,Ida Ayu Putu Trisnawati,5,"The restaurant is very near Malioboro. Stumbled this place accidentally. The owners are very friendly and humble. Their food is very good. Even tho the place doesn't look nice from the outside, it's worth to try."
3203,ChIJu46AxyZYei4RuIq-5pavcfA,Makmur Restaurant,Tyler Doble,5,"As a westerner, I probably wouldn't go into this kind of establishment normally. However, I stepped too far in and had to go through with it. My girlfriend and I ordered some noodles, rice and sweet pork... Honestly, I was extremely glad I went in!

While the cleanliness might be in question, the food quality certainly is not. It was absolutely delicious and put a smile on my face the whole time. The food is extremely good value for money and I will recommend it to anyone who is in the area. Next time I'm down here with friends, we'll all go and get some tasty food!

This place gets a big ol' thumbs up from me! üëç"
3204,ChIJwYfUbaNXei4RBQWELFjAYTA,Indie Restaurant,Marc Globetrotter,2,I came to eat Indie but here no Indian dish. I ate a spaghetti bolognese one portion. and beer is not served before 3 p.m. and there are additional taxes to pay.

3209,ChIJAx-ueuhZei4Rn4_nPQ6LZwE,SamaZana Restaurant,Charmaine V,5,"A dinning experience with a difference.

Went for the Christmas buffet dinner displaying an array of dishes which felt like a  carnival fiesta of flavours.

The variety was spectacular, each dish was made to perfection, service was like clockwork with attention to minute details.
Each dish hit the right flavour and taste which was juicy and moist.

Totally brilliant, live music added to the charm of the awesome dinning experience.

Indoor and outdoor seating area available."
3210,ChIJAx-ueuhZei4Rn4_nPQ6LZwE,SamaZana Restaurant,Adinda Febrina,3,"Well, it's not my favorite buffet. I found a bit difficult to explore and haunting the food. It's all around and we had to walk through other tables and guests. It's not only one corner, but it spots ""there"", ""there"" and ""there"".
And the steak was hard and dry. But, laksa was delicious. For me the price was incredible cheap for buffet, it costs 155K pr. Person.
Unluckily, we were sit outside near the pool, and it's extremely hot. And another unlucky was, the smoking guests next to our table.
I wasn't sure it's allowed to smoke there even  its outside.
The welcoming staffs were nice and pretty with nice uniform üòä"
3211,ChIJAx-ueuhZei4Rn4_nPQ6LZwE,SamaZana Restaurant,Khairul Anwar,5,"Top notch MediterrAsian restaurant in Yogyakarta. Healthy selections are available freshly prepared here. Elegant interior, warm ambiance, attentive service and Kid friendly. Sop Buntut & Soto Iga Tangkar are two most fav menu from my side. Enjoy their all-you-can-eat breakfast which happened to win the best breakfast in Indonesia last year! Keep it up!"
3212,ChIJAx-ueuhZei4Rn4_nPQ6LZwE,SamaZana Restaurant,dev camu,5,"I like the new refurbished restaurant. When I came, the staff greeting me with warm greeting. They also offer me the seat that have good view.
Forgot to mention, that the restaurant is following the Covid19 protap. There's a standing thermocam on the entrance, and also hand sanitizer stand. The seating also is already set up for maintain the distance with other guest.
I like the carbonara pasta very much. Thumbs up for the Chef."
3213,ChIJAx-ueuhZei4Rn4_nPQ6LZwE,SamaZana Restaurant,Theresia Bertha,5,"PATEHAN - Best experience!! The package include some traditional activities you have to try during your stay here. Really worth the price. Got to try royal tea ceremony, museum visit, jemparingan (javanese archery) and javanese traditional dance."
3214,ChIJB7rcodZZei4ROcjvKzgppxQ,Dapur Manado Restaurant,Ayi,3,"I ordered nasi campur cakalang and panada. The panada is not bad, the filling is well seasoned. But I find the taste of the nasi campur cakalang rather odd. It's a bit bitter I dont know why. I think they over spiced the cakalang."
3215,ChIJB7rcodZZei4ROcjvKzgppxQ,Dapur Manado Restaurant,Qonita Aulia R,5,"Perfect combo! Great ambience and tasty! Such an authentic cuisine. Their kitchen is semi open style, clean and neat, they handle the fish very well (since it doesn't smell fishy), combined with fresh sambal. Meeting rooms are available too. A little pricey but reasonable. Must try the klapetart!"
3216,ChIJB7rcodZZei4ROcjvKzgppxQ,Dapur Manado Restaurant,Helly Minarti,5,"One of my fave resto in the city. The food, the place/location and the desserts! I am a big fan of Manado/North Sulawesi food, and finding this gem is something. I am a Jakartan living in Jogja so I was spoiled by the choices of Manado-themed restos back in the capital. Hence, finding this resto is literally, a relief."
3217,ChIJB7rcodZZei4ROcjvKzgppxQ,Dapur Manado Restaurant,Pradipta Wijaya,5,Best manado cuisine in town imo. Quiet ambience and comfort. Old architecture. Has a prayer room.
3218,ChIJB7rcodZZei4ROcjvKzgppxQ,Dapur Manado Restaurant,aya,5,"This place is very clean, comfy, and the food also great. They sell menu in portion for sharing or individual portion, also signature manado snack such as panada and klappertaart.
What i love the most beside the taste of the food, the hygiene of this place. You can see thorough the kitchen, it's really clean.
They have a lot of vintage cupboards and plants, remind me of my childhood.
The price is very affordable for manado food."

All of the foods in the buffet were not fully cooked, so you just point at what food you want to eat, the staffs will cook it for you. Don't worry it won't take too long. The food's taste were superb, delicious. We loved it very much.

3226,ChIJAURypDRYei4Rq6DGNK7W_4Y,Restoran Bumbu Desa,Daniel Umar,5,"Awesome traditional food restaurant located in the middle of the city. It is not at the main road you have to go through small road, not that easy to find for people from out of town.

This restaurants provides loads of menus, you might feel overwhelmed which one to choose. All foods I choose tastes really awesome.

Price is a bit high for traditional foods, though it is actually reasonable considering the place, service, and foods. With lot of seating available this place is perfect for group linch or family dinner."
