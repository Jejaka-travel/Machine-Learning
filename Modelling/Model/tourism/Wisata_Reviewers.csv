0,ChIJZ5sY9kM90i0RVsPvSxZD7LY,Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary,Suzanna Kejairi,5,Monkey Forest is the perfect attraction for all ages and a respite from the heat. You can spend a long time watching the monkeys play with each other. The park itself is beautiful. There are amazingly detailed statues everywhere. The monkeys are great just follow the rules. Don't make eye contact and carry your belongings tight. There are many ancient banyan trees. You may only need a couple hours at most to see everything. Definitely a place to see if you're in Ubud.,1934
1,ChIJZ5sY9kM90i0RVsPvSxZD7LY,Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary,K Baz,1,"Would not do this again. The monkey forest is not a sanctuary. It is a tourist trap designed for people to indulge in exploitative photo opportunities with monkeys.

These beautiful animals deserve better. We saw a Chinese tourist exiting one of the First Aid centres on his way to hospital after being bitten as well as two young girls foolishly holding a water bottle being chased by a monkey. Signs clearly state no water bottles. They also state ""no feeding monkeys"", yet the staff use food to get monkeys to sit and climb on tourists for pictures. This has conditioned the monkeys to climb on people.

We kept our distance. All of my pictures were taken with a zoom lens and we kept moving, Staying still had you surrounded by monkeys who do not understand the difference between someone sitting down to rest and someone paying to have a picture taken by using food as an incentive.

Beautiful Forest but not entirely comfortable with monkeys being used as props. I love monkeys but they are wild and deserve respect üêí  I felt very sad for these monkeys and at times nervous for my safety üêí üôà

Edit update: the responses to poor reviews by the owner are a clear picture of what you get when you visit.",1108
2,ChIJZ5sY9kM90i0RVsPvSxZD7LY,Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary,Aneka Truman,5,"Wonderful experience. A nice place to explore.

The temples and statues are interesting to see, alongside the main attraction, the monkeys!

We visited on a Saturday afternoon at 4PM. I thought it might be busy with tourists, but it wasn‚Äôt too bad. As time went on the place became quieter.

We walked around the whole complex and saw so many monkeys. Incredible. We had no issues with the monkeys. After reading reviews I didn‚Äôt take any loose items (water, sunglasses, jewellery); we were not bothered by them. I carried my phone and my husband had a bum bag.

We kept our distance from the monkeys and respected them in their habitat. Read and follow the rules and you‚Äôll have a great time. üôè Such a lovely place, suitable for the whole family.",215
3,ChIJZ5sY9kM90i0RVsPvSxZD7LY,Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary,Denise F,5,"I thought the experience was Unforgettable. The grounds are impeccable, the staff friendly and knowledgeable. The monkeys of course are a joy. They appear to be well taken care of, well fed, and photographed frequently. I loved that if I asked a staff member a question they answered it without hesitation and you could tell that a relationship develops between certain staff and certain monkeys. I saw the show in the theater which was well made as well. I went on a Sunday and it was my understanding the tickets were supposed to be 80k, but when I arrived we were told that on weekends or Sundays the tickets are 100k. I thought that the experience was worth it and would do it again.",531
4,ChIJZ5sY9kM90i0RVsPvSxZD7LY,Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary,Abigail Lorenzana,4,It was a good experience! The monkeys are ‚Äúfree‚Äù Be cautious and follow the rules because they bite. Avoid bringing shiny things or valuables like jewelry. They also like plastic bottles and food so don‚Äôt bring any with you if you don‚Äôt want to be mobbed. There are ramps for wheelchairs but not everywhere. I appreciate how some of the walkways in the edges of the stairs are painted bright yellow for safety precautions. It is also well maintained. There are many cleaners. And there are ‚Äúguards‚Äù who have slingshots in case the monkeys try to do anything naughty. You can have pictures with monkeys just ask help from the ‚Äúguards‚Äù around. Do not approach baby monkeys because mothers are protective. Make sure you get a map from the information center especially if you easily get lost. I hope there are more lights in the tunnel next time.,52
5,ChIJx97hVM9E0i0RUVpPBj5miBk,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Christian Hansen,4,"I have to mention, that most of this place was closed due to the G20 summit, so my review is only based on the things that were open at the time.

It's a really pretty park, with some nice surroundings. The monument or statue itself is great and all, and they have some nice explanations in the ground floor, regarding the statue and how it was built.

We couldn't go up the statue, and we couldn't see a lot of the other statues, due to the summit. Overall it was fine, but I think the price was too high in our case.",456
6,ChIJx97hVM9E0i0RUVpPBj5miBk,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Mudita YAdav,3,"It is a very beautiful and aesthetic places to visit. But the cost of the ticket is a little steep. Also when we get inside the campus, there is a ticket. There is also a show and a museum for which we will have to pay extra bucks if we want to watch it. They should give this inclusive at the entrance or atleast inform about the same. Apart from that there is very beautiful and scenic. It is very well maintained and clean.",1390
7,ChIJx97hVM9E0i0RUVpPBj5miBk,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Ivy Land,5,"This is the first time I went to GWK, I was thinking the place is only that big statue that we can see, but I found amazing place and good made..

The place was amazing with incredible Bali dances at their theatre, but the museum was small and only 2 kinds of traditional places, Java and Balinese you can see there.

Overall that was amazing and great to be there.. But when I was there, they're under construction so they said I couldn't go up to see Bali from the statue.. They said they will be finished on Dec.",1008
8,ChIJx97hVM9E0i0RUVpPBj5miBk,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Rahul Bura,4,"Pretty iconic destination for Bali, you can see the Statue anywhere from the south beaches. Even from Canggu! Had to go visit and only managed to get there in the evening so got to see it later at night. It's half price after 7pm so that worked out. Got some pics taken in the Art Museum and walked around the grounds to explore the sculptures. There was a free drink with the ticket which isn't all that, it's just an excuse to get you to the restaurant. Having said that, the restaurant was pretty cool and night time views were great. Didn't eat there unfortunately but might try if I do go again. Overall a tourist destination, not really a holy site so just an FYI.",1623
9,ChIJx97hVM9E0i0RUVpPBj5miBk,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Mario Christianto,4,"It's a nice sized cultural park, with a lot of wide open spaces. You will initially go to the designated parking area and there will be a shuttle bus to bring you to the ticketing area (of note, if you come with a driver/guide, they can come in for free, but you still have to pay for the shuttle cost).
The GWK statue is huge! It's a good photo op. Another great thing to check out is the amphitheater, which has multiple dances and musical performances every hour, highly recommended.
There are multiple restaurants and food court on site, the food are just so-so, but that's to be expected in a tourist spot like this.
The restroom is fairly clean, which is nice. There are multiple souvenir shops of you're interested in shopping.",1297
10,ChIJXfZP2tYg0i0RUaM-yoiFiXs,Leke Leke Waterfall,SM,5,"Beautiful waterfall with some light hiking up and down a path. The path can be very slippery at places and better have some shoes, but flip flops also will do.
We were asked 25k entrance fee per person from a guy which property has an access to the jungle leading to the waterfall. No tickets were given. It might be another free access to the path , but not sure about that.",1776
11,ChIJXfZP2tYg0i0RUaM-yoiFiXs,Leke Leke Waterfall,Kiki Miki,4,"What a nice waterfall!! The way there is incredibly sunning and so is the waterfall itself. The entrance fee is 50k per person which is a lot (all the other waterfalls are 10-20k)- they didn‚Äôt tell us before we entered, they told us after we came back which I think is super rude, that way they don‚Äôt let decide if we want to pay/go or not. The way down takes about 7minutes and the way up around 10minutes, the way is a bit slippery sometimes but if you‚Äôre careful, slippers are fine- no need for closed shoes.",1155
12,ChIJXfZP2tYg0i0RUaM-yoiFiXs,Leke Leke Waterfall,Martius malik,5,"Small waterfall but high, you can safely swim in this waterfall, 15 minutes tracking from the entrance. The track is easy. There's no toilet at the waterfall, only in the cafe at the entrance, there's local people selling coconut on the tracking route for 40k each, well if you generous enough to help the local you can rest here after visiting the waterfall. Best visit time in the early morning around 8 to 9. The tracking not suitable for old people or wheel chair. There's parking for motorcycle and cars on the entrance.",1307
13,ChIJXfZP2tYg0i0RUaM-yoiFiXs,Leke Leke Waterfall,Danny Darkoski,4,"The waterfall was beautiful and quite tall. Couple things very important to keep in mind that I didn‚Äôt see on any reviews before going:

1. You cannot drive up to the entrance if you‚Äôre in a car. There is a parking lot about a km or more away (steep hilly windy roads) and you have to rent a scooter driver for 40k to take you to the entrance/beginning of the trek and back after your hike. If you have you‚Äôre own bike you can take it (go easy) but no cars.

2. If it has been raining the night before or earlier that day, the path is sure to be wet and very slippery and muddy. We met several people on the way that slipped and covered in mud.

Older people or less experienced hikers I wouldn‚Äôt recommended this waterfall especially if it‚Äôs wet. Besides that it‚Äôs manageable just be mindful.

The waterfall itself is amazing tho and plenty of room for a swim. There‚Äôs an uncle about halfway down selling fresh coconuts.

Enjoy ‚ú®",496
14,ChIJXfZP2tYg0i0RUaM-yoiFiXs,Leke Leke Waterfall,rob k,5,"Great hidden gem, very peaceful and a really nice walk from the road to the waterfall. There are alot of steps so make sure you bring the correct footwear.

On our walk we were able to buy some fresh coconuts from a local who has a stall setup.

We drove to thr waterfall via moped, the road is very uneven so make sure you've driven one before. Not for a first timer",2407
15,ChIJoQHcmv8X0i0RI6vXSuiyCOo,Kanto Lampo Waterfall,Mpokgaga E.,5,"Didn't plan to go here, but it was the right decision to stop by and enjoy the waterfall by myself! üòç

Local entrance only 20k, lots of stairs that quite slippery, I suggest don't wear flip flop when you wanna visit üòÖ and all the guides were very friendly and helpful!

They got this quite awesome photo & video shoot skill for tourist, but don't forget to give them tip after you enjoying your time ‚ò∫üòâ

They also sell towel if you forgot to bring yours (just like me) and they also have a quite clean toilet & shower, so you can change your wet clothes.

It was a very awesome short visit, definitely going back soon! ‚ù§",1385
16,ChIJoQHcmv8X0i0RI6vXSuiyCOo,Kanto Lampo Waterfall,Bruce B. - Tiger Man,5,"Nice waterfall!  If you're in the area, I would recommend it.  Entrance fee is 20,000.  They have a warung restaurant near the bottom of the waterfall...good local prices.  They have several guides at the bottom if you want them to show the best places to walk in water and take photos for you.  I tipped the guide 20,000 for his help ...nice guy.",408
17,ChIJoQHcmv8X0i0RI6vXSuiyCOo,Kanto Lampo Waterfall,Deby Firmansyah,5,one of the waterfalls in Bali that must be visited because it is really very good.  to the waterfall it only takes about 5 minutes to go down the stairs.  a lot of foreign tourists who come to visit this waterfall.  there is a toilet so it is safe to change clothes.,520
18,ChIJoQHcmv8X0i0RI6vXSuiyCOo,Kanto Lampo Waterfall,Rian Ilmariandy,4,"Beautiful waterfall cascading along big rocks and jungle with mild stream, a perfect place to just cooling down and relax. Great atmosphere and the rocky walls are bonus. Entrance fee is 20K IDR. The staff and guides were very friendly and attentive, and they're also a great photographer. The waterfall itself is pretty easy to reach, the path is well maintained. Parking space is spacious and there are also many small warung or stalls, selling snacks and drinks. Toilet and changing rooms are available.",1673
19,ChIJoQHcmv8X0i0RI6vXSuiyCOo,Kanto Lampo Waterfall,Myriam Haar,4,Beautiful waterfall cascading along rocks st amidst the wild jungle. Easy to access through a set of steps. Takes around 10 minutes to reach the bottom. You can sit on the rocks although some are slippery. Arrange for a ride back as there is no Grab service in that area.,1424
20,ChIJQ6ocSKAb0i0RP1CIrkak0ws,Tukad Cepung Waterfall,Alexey Tee,5,"Every step going there and back definitely worth this miracle. There are few waterfalls. The biggest one is on the left side along the canyon. Water falls down together with the light making fabulous effect that you can shot on your camera. Amazing combination of the rocks, stones, water and light makes this image great. If you go back to the right side from the stairs along the small river in a 50 meters you will find two more small waterfalls. Have a look to the right cave, step inside walk a few meters and discover one more hidden fantastic waterfall. Don't forget to take flip flops or some shoes for water walk. Entrance is 20000 per person.",159
21,ChIJQ6ocSKAb0i0RP1CIrkak0ws,Tukad Cepung Waterfall,Sandra Mayer,5,"There are two waterfalls, one is a cave and the other one outside. Both are very beautiful. The way down to the waterfalls is a couple of stairs, but good ones, so it‚Äòs fairly easy to get there and not too exhausting. There are a bunch of small restaurants and coffee places on the way down. Makes it more touristy. We were lucky and there were not too many people, so we also didn‚Äòt have to wait long to take our pictures. I recommend either taking shoes you can wear in water or not caring about getting your shoes wet. There is no way to get to the waterfalls with dry feet.",1797
22,ChIJQ6ocSKAb0i0RP1CIrkak0ws,Tukad Cepung Waterfall,Amanda Rudyj,5,"The hike down was full of steep steps and gorgeous scenery, there was a nice stop in the middle for food and drinks. The path leveled out for a bit as you hike along the water way to get down to the last set of steps. Small line to stop and take photos of the cave waterfall to the left and it is not really a swimming hole, but the cold water is refreshing! Then go back past the steps to find 3 more waterfalls‚Ä¶ when you go past the first one (to the right of the steps when looking down) continue further and look right for the cave listen for the water running and don‚Äôt be afraid to go inside, you will find a private treasure of another scenic waterfall with amazing photo opps. Then continue to follow the water and hike up some rocks to stand in the shallow pool and get more waterfall pics! Not really a swimming place but a beautiful piece of nature that will make the trip worth it!",185
23,ChIJQ6ocSKAb0i0RP1CIrkak0ws,Tukad Cepung Waterfall,Ha Thu,5,"It is the most beautiful water fall which I have seen in my life.
Entrance fee is 15k.
You need to walk a bit to go to water fall, but it is amazing. How wonderful mother nature!
I would like to recommended you to visit this place. Never disappointed!",857
24,ChIJQ6ocSKAb0i0RP1CIrkak0ws,Tukad Cepung Waterfall,Kathryn Lim,4,"PSA: first and foremost don‚Äôt wear shoes. I wore thick soled sandals to wade through the water. And best to have swimwear with you!

Anyway onto the actual review‚Ä¶
I think it‚Äôs pretty as shown in the pictures
But lots of tourists, hence 4 stars as I prefer something more quiet.
Nevertheless when you get down the stairs, to the left there are more quiet spots with beautiful waterfalls too.",1126
25,ChIJkYHLIPxP0i0RlQTbpxuNuQw,Uluwatu Temple,Anubhav Ritolia,5,"This is an amazing place to explore in Bali, Indonesia. Must visit if going to Bali, Indonesia for your honeymoon or holidays. Beautiful view, crystal clear water, pure air, etc. Pure nature to look for. Lots of photos can be clicked in different angles. Everyone liked the place. Lots of small shops also for some coconut water and snacks. Coconuts were also so big and tasty. It was feeling like just sitting there for hours and enjoying the view, sound of water, Mountain and birds. And feel the breeze air. Must visit this place if going to Bali with your lover, family and friends and click lots of pictures with lots of memories.",244
26,ChIJkYHLIPxP0i0RlQTbpxuNuQw,Uluwatu Temple,Bralee Pichaiya,5,"Amazing hindu temple on the cliff overlooking the deep blue sea‚ô°

The view is stunning. You need to wear sarong to get it the temple area. Be careful with your hat, sun glasses, and mobile. Monkeys are naughty. They like to snatch them. Would love to go back again.",403
27,ChIJkYHLIPxP0i0RlQTbpxuNuQw,Uluwatu Temple,Herry Maan,5,"Beautiful temple. Beautiful beach. The only con is you cannot go to beach from temple. The views are so beautiful.
You have to wear a cloth to cover your legs if your clothing is above the knee length or you can say your knees are showing. Else just have to wear a cloth on stomach.
Local people pray here. Lots of spots to get pictures and enjoy a beautiful sunset. The balli dance is famous of here. Must watch but book in advance else tickets runs out very quick.
Note : make sure you keep your things safe, lots of monkeys are here.",919
28,ChIJkYHLIPxP0i0RlQTbpxuNuQw,Uluwatu Temple,Chathu Kularathna,5,"A beautiful and serene temple built on sea cliff. We visited here in 2019. I recommend visiting the temple in early morning if you don‚Äôt like crowds. Amazing views of the sea, surrounding cliffs and trees. You will have to wear a sarong. Some of the worship areas are closed for tourists.
There are quite number of monkeys, so don‚Äôt bring food.",442
29,ChIJkYHLIPxP0i0RlQTbpxuNuQw,Uluwatu Temple,Robo Bears,5,"A place with a unique atmosphere, I recommend a visit in the early hours, it gets quite crowded in the afternoon and it is more difficult to take good photos there. And especially beware of personal belongings, monkeys live there who are terribly curious and like to take things that don't belong to them.",1732
30,ChIJy52SWnGJ0S0RwgkbkQnE2IA,Daya Tarik Wisata Bedugul,Hendy Ho,5,"Should proud to be Indonesian and have this beautiful landscape, should try feeding the fish at the north west there are only $10 for the feeders its fun but try to not coming when peak hours 11-3pm, hot weather and many tourists come over there.",907
31,ChIJy52SWnGJ0S0RwgkbkQnE2IA,Daya Tarik Wisata Bedugul,Erwin Teunissen,5,"I loved this place.
Worth the visit. They have great statues, beautiful temples and gardens, some animals.
Definitely worth the visit.",688
32,ChIJy52SWnGJ0S0RwgkbkQnE2IA,Daya Tarik Wisata Bedugul,Ali Yawar,5,"This place was one of the best places for tourists to visit before pandemic. but, now it's empty there is no foreign tourists except some local visitors.",167
33,ChIJy52SWnGJ0S0RwgkbkQnE2IA,Daya Tarik Wisata Bedugul,Gede Eka Saputra,5,"a clean, comfortable, cool tourist spot, the garden is neatly arranged with various flowers, it looks like the maintenance is very good. it's just that there are no photo services like in other tourist attractions, so it's rather difficult to capture portraits with your family.",810
34,ChIJy52SWnGJ0S0RwgkbkQnE2IA,Daya Tarik Wisata Bedugul,Azara Ingram,5,"Chill place. Nice lake. Good views
No cost",322
35,ChIJFZjn43YI0i0R8hFdqu2zmvw,Taman Ujung,FYM,5,Good place for taking photos and if you love plants and flowers. Beautiful garden and little history of the local king. Spacious and great cared. Prices for foreigners is 75k ( 6$) and 50k (for locals). Light is great if is a sunny day and best spots are for sure the bridges and the lake. Recommended to come here early morning if you want the place more to yourself.,702
36,ChIJFZjn43YI0i0R8hFdqu2zmvw,Taman Ujung,Adam Cohen,3,Not much to do or see at Taman Ujung. It is picturesque like the rest of Bali and that is because this was one of the the kings residence. You climb a lot of stairs expecting to see something new but it‚Äôs usually just a scenic area. There are definitely better temples to spend your time at. Entrance fee is 75k per person. I don‚Äôt recommend.,66
37,ChIJFZjn43YI0i0R8hFdqu2zmvw,Taman Ujung,Daria Alfimova,5,"Why people seldom mention this place to visit? Absolutely great experience. Beautiful, quiet palace with a lot of photo spots and 2 view points.

75k for the entrance. I recommend to take more than one hour ti spend there.

Also you can have a lunch/picnic right there on the grass.",497
38,ChIJFZjn43YI0i0R8hFdqu2zmvw,Taman Ujung,Nicholas Stone,4,This is a park with a lake in the centre and some pagoda-like shelters where it is quite pleasant to relax in the shade and breeze. There are a few paths to walk along and various shrubs and small bushes with flowers. There is also a small hill you can climb up from where you can enjoy views of the park and surrounding areas towards the sea. Allow 30 minutes to one hour for your visit. Longer if you want to relax and read a book etc.,1473
39,ChIJFZjn43YI0i0R8hFdqu2zmvw,Taman Ujung,ChunJin Tan,4,"Beautiful place for a walk, and it's probably a great place for photography too.
The entire place is very well maintained and serene. Only a handful of locals and foreigners there, you can enjoy the peace and quiet walk there. Good mix of flora and fauna too.",464
40,ChIJLRhilH4V0i0Rez5UbFcCNm4,Hidden Canyon Beji Guwang,Aga Ufland,5,"An amazing place! Worth a visit! We spent 2 unforgettable hours with our funny and attentive guides, exploring the canyons. The shade and water were a great escape from the heat. It was worth every penny (240k/person, including lunch with lovely view, water, towel and insurance!). They made sure our 5-year old son had a great time and he absolutely loved it! Even my panicky sister who's afraid of water enjoyed it a lot! The water was a little deep at times but the guides made us feel 100% safe. No need to schedule in advance - you can come anytime. Come and support this lovely initiative!",101
41,ChIJLRhilH4V0i0Rez5UbFcCNm4,Hidden Canyon Beji Guwang,Adam Howarth,5,"We had a wonderful afternoon here, 3 adults and 2 kids (11yrs), it took about 3 hours to explore the 3 canyons with 2 very helpful guides.
There was a lot of climbing and swimming involved, the swim into the cave was really amazing with bats flying around above us.  The climbing was was enough to make you feel like a real adventurer, without being too daunting. There are lockers and showers (with towels provided) included in the visit. You will get very wet, so leave your valuables in the car/the lockers.  The guides had a dry bag for my phone and took great photos and videos for us.  Very lucky to visit during the pandemic and have the place to ourselves!",67
42,ChIJLRhilH4V0i0Rez5UbFcCNm4,Hidden Canyon Beji Guwang,Ekaterina Bagdasarova,5,"Amazing! Highly recommended! We were here with three kids, it took us two hours to go through this amazing canyon. It is better to be in swimming suit, because there are some places where you need even to swim. Don't take a towel, you will take it there, it is included in price, the same like a shower. Very beautiful, very interesting. Join it!",650
43,ChIJLRhilH4V0i0Rez5UbFcCNm4,Hidden Canyon Beji Guwang,Rosario Ayala Yoga,5,"Amazing experience! The hike through the river was very fun and the tour guide helped us, showing us where to step, making sure we were secure at all times. You can choose between a short trip or a long one with 3 beautiful canyons. At the end you walk trough rice fields to return to the starting point where you can take a hot shower. The ticket entrance also includes a meal, towels for the shower and the guide, ours was a great photographer! (Guides have waterproof bags to keep phones safe).
Highly recommended!!",1746

Beautiful route to the 3 canyons, I had so much fun with my guide, he was an excellent photographer and know every single step of the route, If you have the chance take  water shoes otherwise you have to do the excursion barefoot (flip flops are dangerous) is very slippery and you can harm yourself on the rocks, also be prepare to get wet til your neck üòÖtakes around 2 hours, if you like adventure and you are a bit fit to climb, swim, and walk that‚Äôs the perfect place to go!",1090
45,ChIJs4sqTRY70i0RSySGSgASiBE,Alas Kedaton,George Messinia,4,"It is a forest inhabited by thousands of monkeys.
At the beginning of the forest, you are greeted by many ladies who work there and also run souvenir shops at the entrance of the forest.
Each lady follows you through the forest and tells you how to treat the monkeys. They also keep a wooden stick in case a monkey goes wild.
At the beginning of the forest, you can buy nuts to feed the monkeys. For safety reasons each lady keeps the nuts.
In the forest there is a temple and at the end there are some bats, which you can take pictures with.
Each lady offers to take pictures with the monkeys, but in the end, she takes you to her shop to buy some souvenirs.",813

At Alas Kedaton there was no one except us and we had a much better experience. We fed so many monkeys at Alas. The staff was so friendly and helpful. We then got to feed and hold massive fruit bats. They are like puppy dogs. There were more monkeys at Alas, crowds were non existent, and they had fruit bats. I highly recommend Alas Kedaton. The only catch is that they want you to buy an item from one of the stores after the experience. I tipped them and bought an item because it was so memorable.",1061
47,ChIJs4sqTRY70i0RSySGSgASiBE,Alas Kedaton,VW,5,It was very rainy when I got there but the people were so sweet and kind. Massive bats ü¶á a guide came and pick me up once I got there.

Ask the guy to take pictures on your phone, just for 20k. Totally worth it. And yes, they take you to their shop afterwards, probably depends on the guide, but mine was pretty friendly and I actually bought a nice shirt for a good price üôÇ",509
50,ChIJpR39aDk90i0RiKhirr8D-5A,Bukit Campuhan,Lars F Clausen,4,"Campuhan Ridge is one of the better free attractions on Ubud. Very beautiful nature walk. Downside is they are building a lot of houses on one of the valley sides, which destroy the nature experience and why this is only 4 starts moving towards 3 stars if they keep building.

It is Bali's largest public park for both locals and tourists to enjoy freely without charge, It is situated in Renon, the island's ""main district"" long long ago, you can see old architecture and more antiquity the more northern you go in Denpasar.

If you're wanting to see Bali's communal beauty and history, visiting this park is a must. It is incredibly ambient and peaceful, you can visit at all times of the day even at noon, since the trees greatly help with providing shade amidst the heat, it is a large park in a not so densely-housed area, there's also a nearby smaller park only 2.5 km (1.4 miles) away.

It is less dense and larger then you might thought. It's over 1.5 km (1 Mile) for one walk around the park's perimeter.

Today, many still exercise around the park and many children here play soccer and basketball, not the mention it's incredibly safe thanks to the hospitality of the locals, and also considering the fact that this area is near major government & police offices and buildings.

there's many restaurants and shops nearby, as well as many crossings in the road. If your still in the park you can find people offering snacks and even cold drinks at local prices.",1552

The monument is quite impressive and set in the grounds of a large park which was totally empty on a Saturday at around 1pm. When we drove past later on it was so busy with locals though!

Bajra Sandhi Monument located in the heart of Denpasar, which makes it easily accessible to visitors.

We had a lot of fun even just visiting and we made a lot of nice photos. The road to Alas Harum is also nice, packed with artisan shops, statues, woodwork, paintings and other stuff.

Kadek was such a kind and caring guide (even loaning his flip flops to my friend who didn‚Äôt have waterproof shoes). There were hardly any other visitors and we got to swim in each of the waterfalls pools on our own! A few tips: park at the little restaurant/accommodation just before the small trail goes down, it is very steep and narrow and the guides will drive you back to your scooter or car after the hike, this is included in the price. I‚Äôd also recommend wearing shoes that you don‚Äôt mind getting wet because the rocks are very slippery and it was much easier to walk over them in shoes and you will do quite a bit of walking through mid-calf rocky water. The guides also offer to carry your backpacks and they will take all your videos and pictures for the day!

We were on a scooters, first we went there from the Fiji Warung side. As soon as we turn in to the street, about five people started to follow us and told us that we have to pay for ""local guide"". But we went to Warung to get some drinks first. We were there for about 30 minutes but don't worry-local guides will wait for you even that long:) we paid for a parking 2000IDR per scooter, and then fun started. We wanted to buy tickets to see waterfall, but when we refused to pay for a ""local guide"" they started to be very rude and agressive. They even said that something may happen to our scooters if we leave them. We ended up leaving after long argue with them, none of them had any guide ID or even some sort of proof that they are legit workers. We didn't want to support local cheaters, as soon as they see tourist they just see money.
Then we tried from the other side, when you drive there, you can see plenty of signs and every single one says OFFICIAL parking or OFFICIAL entrance (obviously). We used the main gate, and as soon as you pass it some people try to stop you because it's OFFICIAL parking. Ignore them and don't even stop, follow the road and at the end there is a shop/coffee place. We bought there 2 bottles of water and the lady let us park there. Then there is a desk that looks kind of official, at least people who are there, have some ID that they are some kind of guides. If you want to see waterfall from top, buy the cheapest ticket. If you want to go down and swim in the waterfall you have to pay for a guide (obviously it's goverment regulation- according to them).
After all I can say that it's worth to go and see that waterfall but seriously, insted of having some respect for the tourists, local people around the waterfall just want to cheat you and get as much of your money as they can.",1286

As you make your way down the winding path, the sounds and scents of nature envelop you, and the lush greenery that surrounds you is a testament to the enduring power of the natural world.

Upon arriving at the waterfall, you are greeted by a breathtaking sight that seems almost otherworldly. The water cascades down the rocks in a shimmering curtain of mist and rainbows, creating a mesmerizing, almost hypnotic effect that fills you with a sense of wonder and awe.",839

The monkeys are territorial, there are 3 different groups and no trespassing is allowed between them (or else the trespassing monkey will be attacked).
There's a reasonable entrance fee.
Also I would suggest you use one of the on-site tour guides. They really help in 'crowd control' (monkeys-wise) and to get really good photos with the monkeys. There's no set price for these guides and your 'donation' is voluntary but i think it's good form to give them a good tip.
Remember not to panic, no sudden moves, listen to your guide, don't bring food, leave your sunglasses. In fact, leave everything except your wallet and cellphone.
Towards the end of your tour, there's a few shops selling souvenirs and food. You can bargain for the price of the souvenirs but again, maybe don't bargain too hard, these shop owners aren't swimming in money and the COVID pandemic has been hard on them, so maybe we can be a little bit more generous than usual.",1297

111,ChIJDSEiPAyJ0S0RxX3GamOTQ4k,Bali Botanical Garden,Kinda Tabbaa-Snyder,3,"An Average Experience with Room for Improvement

During my visit to the Bali Botanical Park, I had an average experience that left me with mixed feelings. While there were some aspects that stood out, there were also areas where improvements could be made.

One of the main issues I encountered was the lack of efficient exploration options within the park. Walking through the vast grounds proved to be quite challenging and time-consuming, especially if you have limited time or are not in the best physical shape. I would strongly recommend renting a bicycle or an electric scooter to cover more ground and make the most of your visit.

Navigating the park also proved to be a bit confusing, and I wasted a significant amount of time trying to find my way around. Although I obtained a map from the information center, it didn't provide clear directions, leading to unnecessary detours and frustration.

Despite these setbacks, I found the statues along the middle road extending from the main gate to be the most captivating aspect of the park. They added a touch of intrigue and cultural significance to the surroundings, making it a worthwhile experience. Additionally, the highlight of the park was undoubtedly the breathtaking Lakeview. I highly recommend making the effort to reach it, as the tranquil beauty of the lake is truly worth the journey.

Unfortunately, for enthusiasts of plants like myself, the park didn't offer much in terms of botanical wonders. The focus seemed to be more on the statues and the scenic views, rather than a diverse range of plant species. However, I do regret not spending more time exploring the nurseries located just before the park entrance, as I've heard they boast a stunning variety of plants.

Overall, my visit to the Bali Botanical Park left me with mixed feelings. While there were elements that stood out, such as the statues and the captivating Lakeview, improvements in terms of navigation and plant diversity could greatly enhance the overall experience. I would recommend this park to those seeking cultural experience, but for true plant enthusiasts, there might be better options available.",1160

I used to find different stuff on the beach in the morning, like fish I posted, which might be pretty dangerous, but certainly very interesting for me.

I took away one star because it's really hard to swim in the very big waves on this beach. However, that's just great for surfing, choose your piece of bread.",1678

It stretches 1 km from the west to the east.

The beach is flat most of the time but there's also a paved foot path alongside of it - with lots of f&b vendors built to offer you fresh coconuts, cold beverages, snacks and parasol loungers. You may also tip the vendor for keeping an eye on your belongings while you're in the water if you're visiting alone.

It's a family friendly site that's good for surfing & swimming but the current can get rough so be sure to swim between the two red & yellow flags.

The better built area is where the central park is (west of Roosterfish Club) where there's a clean toilet, shower & changing room, canoeing boats and the parking lot all in close proximity.

The water is nicely hot, especially the one that comes directly from the pipe. It's perfect for a relaxing soak, and the natural heat of the water is incredibly soothing

The photos of the private room really don't do justice. It looked dirty and uncomfortable. But it was actually nice. I would hate to be in a slippery or dirty bath, but this was ok. My husband loved it even more. Additionally, like any natural hot spring, the water may have a strong sulfur smell that can be unpleasant for some.

We didn't try the natural pool, although the view looked better. It's because the water is so much less warm compared to the one in the private bath.",266

Early in the morning, 11'o clock AM, my friend and I are sitting at the cafe, discussing our next location in our two week Bali adventure. We want to go somewhere the locals go. Avoiding all the tourists that swamp the island during the European summer months. We decided we want to see a waterfall. So, where do you go? There are so many, and we just couldn't decide. So we decided fate would choose for us and just chose one we saw on the map. Batu Lantang. After a one hour journey on our rented scooters, we arrive at the site. The entrance isn't clearly marked. Just a simple sign pointing down a hill into the jungle. For a moment we doubted continuing but decided to follow the arrow pointing down.

A small track zigzags down. First, it's just a dirt path. Then it transforms into a small wall made of brick. On one side a small stream of water and the mountain wall, on the other side a very steep drop down into the jungle. You don't want to fall down here. It must be at least 50 meters down. That's 160 feet for you Americans.

The brick wall must be just 2 feet wide. We carefully place our feet while making sure we keep our balance. After 10 minutes walking carefully along the ledge and while the jungle kisses our feet with her leaves, we see a second arrow pointing us at the waterfall. At least we didn't get lost!

A third arrow comes into view.  It directs us through some high grass. Man, I wish I didn't choose my shorts for this trip. Carefully we continue through the tall grass when suddenly the grass starts moving. It shocked me, keep in mind Indonesia has snakes, and you don't want to get bitten by them. I almost lost my balance, then realizing it's a small cute salamander moving harmlessly through the grass. We probably scared it first.

We've come pretty far. And we must have been walking for a good 30 minutes already. Then the path changes. It disappears into a wall of loose dirt. We can barely cross it, using our fingers to grip the dirt and carefully crossing the loose sand. On the other side, there is another arrow pointing down that scary wall of dirt we just crossed. The path wraps around a tree and then we saw a rope. The rope is there to help you descend further down the mountain. About 5/7 meters down we arrive at the bottom.

At that point, we can clearly hear the waterfall roaring. We even hear some voices of children laughing and playing.

Continuing the path towards the sound we are greeted with an amazing sight. Out of nowhere, the waterfall appears. It is so beatiful we have to take a moment to take in its beauty. The next two hours are spent bathing and having fun with the local Indonesian children. They guided us through the water, marking the shallow spots you can easily cross. It was truly an amazing experience and one I'll never forget.",2266

You also have to pay for rental of the floats to take the rides: 15k for double seater float and 10k for a single. The costs do add up although the entry fee is relatively cheap for a waterpark. It is extremely crowded and full of children and families on the weekend. People sitting around on the floor and eating as there are no tables or chairs. The food which also attracted flies.

Poor sanitation and hygiene of the place. There was poo in the toilet and pee smell in various places within the waterpark. Overcrowded toilets and no space to change or shower.

A gem i would say. I came few hours after d rain and this place has very very few people visiting it. They have lots of slides and water play area that you can try.

Kids especially would love this since they have many different slides to play with. Its a smaller version of Singapore's Wild Wild Wet.. and to also note, even though this place has been around for some time, it still looks well maintained.

There are guards everywhere so that you can worry less for ur kids swimming where they are not supposed to. And to note, d lazy river and all d rest of d pools not for kids are at least 1.2m. Do jz take note and be wary of where ur kids go at least ya. It is really a nice place to go especially when you dont get to see lots of waterpark in Batam.

The best plus point i would add is the food shops that cater to people coming to this waterpark. Have ur cup noodle, teh botol and snacks while u chill away, resting in d waterpark.

And sshhhh, dun compare to other water slides ya but.....its only 140 000 rp for 2 adults, 2 kids.. so u calculate urslf k... cheers!!!

Young kids also gets to learn about how things are made in a factoy such as books, chocolate, tea, instant noodle, cookies, towel etc.they get to learn about the process and being involved in the production process so it is very educational. The entrance fee is a bit pricey but free for grandma and grandpa. IMO this place is suitable for ages 3 to 10 years old; not much to experience for kids above these ages, not value for money at least. If you want to spend good money and learning experience for your kids, this is the place. But be prepared for kids running around, yelling, screaming and having tantrums, 5 hours is more than enough for me. Well enjoy your quality time with your kids; get rid of that guilty feeling of not spending more time with your kidsüòÄ",699

If you want to catch the sunset I suggest getting there at least half an hour early for two reasons: 1) the sun sets behind hills so if you're late you'll probably miss it, and 2) it can get crowded and if you want a good spot you'll have to claim it (there were around 150 people during the sunset on a weekday; mix of locals and tourists).

The atmosphere is a bit festive (kind of like a small country fair) with vendors selling BBQ corn, snacks and beer.

There is a new road that will take you all the way up to the top via car or scooter--no hiking required. Entrance fee collected by locals was 10k rupiah (felt a bit scammy but not any different than parking access at the local beaches).",539

The first waterfall is only a few steps down from the entrance. The second will take you 15-25 minutes depending on how quickly you wade through the stream.

Tips: get some reef shoes or equivalent. Will make life so much easier to reach the second waterfall. The path is not clearly marked to the second waterfall so if you go at a quiet time and there aren‚Äôt people to follow, keep an eye on the man made wall (rocks trapped with wire). There will be a path behind that if you find yourself on the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô side of the stream. Monkeys can block the path and appear aggressive.

Seger Beach brings an array of colourful and active underwater life, making it a hotspot for snorkellers.

On any given day, you will see surfers, swimmers and sunbathers scattered across the beach. Seger Beach is a quieter alternative to Kuta Beach with a different aspect and view of the water. The beach has a local warung (cafe) beside it and other restaurants nearby so you can easily spend the day there.

Should you visit during February, there is the Bau Nyale ceremony where locals go out to catch sea worms (Nyale) along the beach. The purpose of this is believed to be part of the incarnation of Princess Mandalika.

There are a number of accommodation options in Kuta, making it easy to plan your stay. The hills surrounding Seger Beach bring an incredible vantage point over the water.

Really the only downsides are watching the porters heroically carrying 30+kg loads on wooden planks in their shoulders while making sub-minimum wages and the sheer amount of rubbish and toilet paper left behind by visitors. Please bring warm clothes and your sleeping bag to the summit, pack out your trash and tip your guide and porters generously (they deserve it!)",397
1379,ChIJ3f___z_NzS0RYcKdlU9Vb_g,Mount Rinjani National Park,Catalina Poplicean Lar,4,"This is not an easy hike, don't take it lightly!

Yes, you have a guide as it's mandatory (even though I don't think someone will stop you if you want to go alone, compared to Batur or other mountains in Indonesia) but he will not carry you down the mountain, not does anyone warn you how demanding this hike is.

Keep in mind that you climb and descent 2700 m in more or less 24 hours and that above 3000 m the lack of oxygen will get to you. The last hundred meters are a mental battle as you ascent really slowly, one step at a time.

We were the fastest group that morning and we could see everyone struggling and only few people reaching the top. Had it been a windy day I'm pretty sure we would have turned back as we weren't properly equiped, the temperature easily gets below 0 and nobody warns you about this (it's pretty obvious given the altitude but we've seen people that have never hiked before so I thought it was worth mentioning).

Warnings aside, the mountain is very beautiful and the view from the top breathtaking.

Unfortunately it is full of trash, I've never seen so much trash on a mountain and the guides and porters keep saying that it the local's people fault. However, they don't do anything to clean the place and I'm afraid they also contribute, even if they claim they take all the trash down. It's such a shame that such an amazing place visited by so many tourists, both local and foreigners is in such bad shape.

Also, the tour companies charge a fortune for what they offer and I really wish there was a way that the money we pay be used to conserve this beautiful natural park.",430

This beach has black sand and high cliffs that adorn the beach.
A Brief History of Lombok's Cliff Coast
The beautiful cliffs on the beach are the result of the devastating eruption of Mount Rinjani Tua or Samalas in 1257. This was written in an article based on research by 15 world volcano researchers with team leader Franck Lavigne, University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne, France. The eruption of Mount Samalas is considered the largest in the last 7,000 years. The material vomit reached more than 40 cubic kilometers. Meanwhile, the cliffs at Tebing Beach are said to be one of the traces of the eruption of Mount Samalas in North Lombok.
Lombok Cliff Beach is located in Luk Hamlet, Sambi Bangkol Village, Gangga District, North Lombok Regency, NTB.
This beach is also very popular as a fishing spot. On this beach there are many fishermen who hunt fish too. There are several great spots for fishing. Don't worry, the locals tell people about sport fishing spots, the locals are quite friendly with everyone.
The sea water on Lombok's Tebing Beach is famous for being clear and has attractive sea views. Coral reefs and small fish accompany swimming here.",143

Compared to other villages both in Malang and in Indonesia, Kampung Kramat is fairly unique and unusual because it is located within the Kasin Public Cemetery (TPU) complex. This location also makes this village named Kampung Kramat.

It's not only related to the location and the name of the village that is unique, their life and profession are also somewhat unique.

In life, almost all of their activities are carried out in the burial area from living, playing, relaxing, to socializing. Even with their profession, most of them are involved as grave diggers, gravestone carvers, people who wash the bodies, caretakers of graves, and others.

First you will go to Main Hall Zone or Vehicle Museum on the 1st floor. It contains many history of vehicles such as the first bicycle, the first car, the first racing car and first motor bike. They have driving simulation too and mixing car parts. I really amazed because they have absolutely stunning collections of historical and cultural cars.

You can choose to use stairs or lifts to go to 2nd floor. Here is the Education Zone. You can see the historical public transportation like a pedicabs, trolleys, chariots, charriages, horses, carts, wagons, trains and many more. At the edge they have formula 1 Ferrari section with driving simulator too.
While the 3rd floor can be guarantee is a nice experience since you will be leading and guiding to see and feel the presidential plane of Indonesia. You can also stop by to buy merchandise and toys here. The have flight simulator too and wind simulator with a decent price. They have playing ground between the 2nd and the 3rd floor with air themed.

Next you will enter the Sunda Kelapa Zone (Jakarta Batavia in colonial age). Here you will get vintage vehicles and the presence of what it might goes to live during that time. There are carts, wagons, early trucks and early cars.

Soon enough you will entry the gangster town and Broadway street. Here is the main attraction, started in 4pm you can see the stunning performance of professional called Man on Fire using MGA 1500,Datsun 280Z, Pontiac GTO and Stingray. Dang they will amazed you with their 360 degress spinning. One of the stunt even using smoking fire cracker while getting out of car and stand in the car while the car is still running. I will give this 96 out of 100. What a performance. If you lucky enough you can be picked by the stunt drivers.

Next is Hollywood zone, here you can be seeing vintage and cultural cars in many big movies. At the 5.30 pm they will have the parade and the dancing performance while using superheroes costumes. They also have the replica of Batmobile and Scobby Doo Van.

European Zone will come next with many photo spots. I have to admitted that this miniature of Europe is really well designed. The Big Companies from Italy, Germany, France and British all here. I wonder how can they get all this cars. Many of the vintage cars is limited and only been build very few like the french presidential car, the Queen Victoria cars and many more.

The Las Vegas zone is not that good only the exceptional H2 Long Limousine Hummer. They put the lights on the cars so you can clearly see how it looks. The zone also connect to flight simulator and flight practice.

Last but not least you will have Pasar Apung to rest your leg and grabbing some snack and have a bite of traditional foods here. There are also merchandise and souviner here.

You need to bring bottle of water and snack with you cause of the long road, and using comfort shoes or sneakers will also help.

Best place to take your family , couple or friends to hang out.
The view and the atmosphere is feel so good
All green , you can see the tree and grass all green and there's special too because you can smell 'the green' (tree and grass scent)
This place is about 40 minutes from medan city (Merdeka Walk) , when you're going to here you'll see almost all green from left and right , you'll see the rice , tree , grass . It's all can make you stop thinking about the stress for a moment.
When you arrive at the place if you ride a motorcycle you need take the left side inside because the parking lot for motorcycle is left side and for car there's right side
The ticket is Rp 15.000 (because it's sunday)from the info i hear it should be Rp 10.000 at the work days (monday - friday maybe ?)
And the parking ticket cost you Rp 3.000 (motorcycle) and about car i don't really know
It's all included when you enter the parking lot you need to pay the ticket and parking ticket
Note : there's a bonus from the park , you can exchange the ticket with 1 drink / ticket and it's free (yeahh.. everything free are make us happy right ? ü§≠)
After you going in you can see alot of pond
And there's a restaurant that welcome you with alot of rainbow color.
And if you keep walking in you'll see another pond and alot of tree and there are alot of seat made of wood , best spot to sit if you getting tired
And inside the park there are alot of small canteen selling drink and snack or food to accompany you when you taking a walk
Here are some attraction at the park and the price :
- Water Ball ( don't know )
- Duck cycling ( Rp 10.000 / person for 15 minutes)

- Mini zoo ( free )
- Flying fox ( don't know )
- Nursery ( free )
- Train ( Rp 15.000 if I'm not false )
- Sado (horse-drawn carriage) ( don't know )
- and more

And here if you ask me ""how bout the food , the price ?""
The food is standard , and there are a small merchant sell snack and it's delicious too
And this is it the best review from me is the price is kinda cheap and some foods are standart . For the snack it's cheap , you can buy :
- Fried sausage , nugget , egg , etc : Rp 1.000 / item
- Pop-Ice : Rp 5.000
- Meatballs : Rp 10.000
- Onion chips (Keripik bawang) : Rp 5.000
And if you go to the restaurant the price is kinda standard :
- Coconut Rp 15.000
- Lemon tea Rp 8.000

It's almost like an open-air park. I don't know whether it's really worth visiting for all, but only if you have a bit or more of curiosity on Indonesian culture, maybe it's worth spending some time on it and tick the list.

Some places are not allowed to even enter, but it seems okay to enter into because it is just open. As a result, a staff runs to me and gets very angry in Indonesian language. You'd better show a warning sign in English!

On 20 June 1812, Stamford Raffles led a 1,200-strong British force to attack the walled royal city of Yogyakarta. Although they outnumbered the British, the Javanese were unprepared for the attack. Yogyakarta fell in one day, and the palace was sacked and burned. A total of ¬£15,000 in gold, jewels and currency (currently valued at ¬£500,000) was looted. It was the first attack on a Javanese court, and the sultanate was subjugated to colonial authority.

3068,ChIJtYZr87NZei4RAatspai7RAg,Lembah UGM Lake,Agus PD,4,"Lembah UGM is one of he hidden nature park inside the UGM sprawling compound. There's a jogging/walking track weaving through tall trees and leading to a small lake. Some parts of the paved tracks are in need of repairs. The renovated stadium now painted in very bright red and white color. In early January 2023, there're lots of broken branches and leaves along the pathways. There's so much rain the cleaning crews are busy elsewhere. Overall, the park is an oasis in the middle of busy Yogyakarta.",118

3070,ChIJtYZr87NZei4RAatspai7RAg,Lembah UGM Lake,Fadila,5,This is my favorite place around UGM. Not only It offers a nice path to jog but also it is good to spend time with loves one. The lake is so clean and there are also people who clean the place regularly. If you go here park near the BNI restaurant or the gate that wrote  'lembah ugm'. There please dont leave any trash or stupidly throw the random trash to the lake. The place is just really good to 'escape' to the hustle bustle of the city and you can even find the sound of the bird when you are jogging or walking. The best time to go here is in the morning and the afternoon. Dont forget to wear a mosquito repellent  when you are here as it is forest and the lake and they will be a lot of mosquitoes or bugs. There is two swan in the lake. So beautiful!,708
